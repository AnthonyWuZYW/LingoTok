1
00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:03,900
have I ever told you the story of the

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,366
old man and the young boy

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,600
well, you see, the young boy walks up to the old man and says

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,066
I want to see the world

5
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,300
the old man laughs

6
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:15,733
no you don't

7
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,533
the young boy was surprised by his answer

8
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,133
he said yes yes I do

9
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,166
you've seen the world why wouldn't

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,933
the old man calmly replied

11
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:28,166
because you don't travel the world to see it

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,533
you don't go to Iceland to see it

13
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,000
you go to Iceland to know what it means to

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,300
breathe fresh air

15
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:43,000
even when it takes your breath away all together

16
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:49,366
you go to understand how the earth was made

17
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:54,466
and feel that power for yourself

1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,905
Things we all did as kids 

2
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:04,040
Using a mechanical pencil to do this

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,480
because we thought it was edgy.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,040
Trying to balance the light switch between on and off, 

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,680
and then our parents would get mad. 

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,440
Doing this yoga pose and seeing who could hold it the longest, 

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,120
whatever the heck this is called, 

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,840
maybe counter uppies.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,680
Draw the special "s"

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,205
Try to catch the refrigerator light turning off 

11
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:28,985
Poke the eraser with our pencil over and over and over again, showing no mercy 

12
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:32,600
Stocking all of our fingers on top of each other

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,350
Ice skating with socks and pretending that we were an olympic champion. 

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,830
I got the gold medal every time

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,400
Using a paper roll as a megaphone, 

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,830
Using the electrical box as the meet up spot or the safe spot, 

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,030
My personal favorite drinking Capri Sun and then doing this.

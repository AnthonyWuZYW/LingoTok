1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,400
Can you draw this

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,680
without ever lifting

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,400
your pen

4
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,510
off the paper? 

5
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,840
Probably not, 

6
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,160
but I'm

7
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:06,880
going to show you

8
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:07,400
how. 

9
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,180
I love this trick. 

10
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,390
When I was a kid, 

11
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,830
I showed

12
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,790
this to everyone

13
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,460
and they thought

14
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,150
that I....

15
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,190
was not weird !!!

16
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,960
Here's how you do it

17
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,500
Grab a sheet of paper

18
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,200
and a marker

19
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,430
begin

20
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,630
with the dot,

21
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,370
now maintain

22
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,730
contact with the paper

23
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,650
and stop thinking

24
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,090
in two dimensions

25
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,670
grab the corner of the page

26
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,400
and fold it into the dot. 

27
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,010
Now, while maintaining contact

28
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,850
with the paper, 

29
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,850
move on to the back

30
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,730
of the page

31
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,990
come on up here

32
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,990
come back onto the front

33
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,710
of the page, 

34
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,030
fold the paper flat ...

35
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,450
and Complete the ring.

1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,560
Pov:

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,185
The teacher asks you to draw a flower 

3
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:04,760
and you pull out this one. 

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,000
Why don't we try this one? 

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,280
Draw a circle, 

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,000
then a small circle, 

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,180
add guidelines for three upward petals. 

8
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:27,030
Make this one look a bit 3D

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,270
like it's partially facing upward

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,110
Two petals emerging to the sides. 

11
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:43,300
Now draw the remaining petals. 

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,710
Add in the details however you want.

13
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,450
Look at that, beautiful!

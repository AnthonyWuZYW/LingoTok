1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,000
Remember who invented

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,760
the airplane?!!

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,200
well this guy didn't, 

4
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:03,985
but he's going to 

5
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:04,720
build one, too. 

6
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,920
An amphibious plane

7
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,520
made of recycled materials. 

8
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,360
The first thing he

9
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,240
had to do was build

10
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:09,920
the base

11
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,070
with water bottles

12
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,350
filled with foam. 

13
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,750
He made

14
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,110
a perfect floating base

15
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,470
and added some wheels. 

16
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,820
Then he took one

17
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,140
of those plastic barrels

18
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,540
and cut it in half. 

19
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,740
He screwed metal pipes

20
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,980
to these plastic sheets, 

21
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,020
creating the body

22
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,780
of his plane. 

23
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,190
He added the propeller

24
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,990
in the front. 

25
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,020
He also screwed

26
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,180
on a comfortable seat

27
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,100
in a windshield. 

28
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,770
With PVC pipes, 

29
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,690
softened with heat, 

30
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,490
the man was

31
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,810
able to make the wings

32
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,730
of his plane. 

33
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,870
He painted them

34
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,790
and with his vehicle

35
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,510
on the beach, 

36
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,670
he asked his friends

37
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,070
for help

38
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,990
to finish assembling

39
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,870
all the pieces. 

40
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,160
There was enough wind

41
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,160
that day for the plane

42
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,240
to move through the sand, 

43
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,320
straight into the water. 

44
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,990
What do you think? 

45
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,990
Could this guy

46
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,710
in his plane go

47
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,550
down in history? 

48
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,190
If you're

49
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,150
inspired to build

50
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,310
your own flying machine, 

51
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,510
share your ideas

52
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,190
with us?

1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,333
you complain about a life that you chose

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:03,800
you are not a victim

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,533
not at all

4
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:09,733
your generosity concealed something dirtier and meaner

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,933
you're incapable of facing your ambitions

6
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,133
and you resent me for it

7
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,066
but I'm not the one who put you where you are

8
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,966
I have nothing to do with it

9
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,166
you're not sacrificing yourself as you say

10
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:21,700
you

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,566
choose to sit on the sidelines because you're afraid

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,566
because your pride makes your head

13
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:28,566
explode before you can even come up with a little

14
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,866
germ of an idea

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
and now you wake up

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,933
and your 40 and you need someone to blame

17
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,600
and you're the one to blame

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,366
you're petrified by your own fucking standards

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,966
and your fear of failure

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,333
this is the truth

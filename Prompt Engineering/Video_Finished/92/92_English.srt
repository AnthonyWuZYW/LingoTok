1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,200
11 things, 

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:01,760
people learn

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,600
too late in life. 

4
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,550
One, 

5
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,710
the less you say, 

6
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,950
the more your words

7
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,470
will matter. 

8
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,670
Two, 

9
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,110
don't take

10
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,030
everything personally, 

11
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,670
not everyone

12
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,310
thinks about you

13
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,270
as much as you do. 

14
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,950
Three, 

15
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,550
when you focus on problems, 

16
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,990
you have more problems. 

17
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,750
When you focus on possibilities, 

18
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,270
you'll have more opportunities. 

19
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,990
Four, 

20
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,370
no matter how much

21
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,240
it hurts now, 

22
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,270
someday you will look back and realize

23
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,720
your struggle changed your life

24
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,590
for the better

25
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,360
five. 

26
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,890
You meet people for a reason. 

27
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,490
Either you need

28
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,530
them to change your life

29
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,130
or you're the one

30
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,810
that will change theirs, 

31
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,560
six. 

32
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,750
Never be afraid to try something new. 

33
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,950
Life gets boring when you stay

34
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,590
within the limits

35
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,910
of what you already know. 

36
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,670
Seven. 

37
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,690
You will never truly know

38
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,930
the value of a moment

39
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,255
until it becomes a memory 

40
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,170
Eight. 

41
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,530
Once you

42
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,250
begin to take note

43
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,890
of the things you

44
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,650
are grateful for, 

45
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,970
you begin to lose sight

46
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,690
of the things that you lack. 

47
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,430
Nine, 

48
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,630
if you do not have control

49
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,350
over your mouth, 

50
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,830
you do not have control

51
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,950
over your future. 

52
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,195
Ten. 

53
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:57,270
life is a mirror

54
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,190
and will reflect back to the thinker

55
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,950
what he thinks in.

1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,712
Are you sureyou're not Jamaican?

2
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:03,830
Yes I am sure

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,230
Well, you look just likethe girl whocleans my house

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,230
Bring me a cup of chamomile tea

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,070
Will you, dear?

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,675
Oh I will let your server know ma'am 

7
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,030
Once we get your lab results back

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,856
Who is that?

9
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:16,910
Dr. Chol?

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,910
I want him.

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,550
Excuse me?

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,950
Oh no offense, dear

13
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,870
The orientals make the best doctors

14
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,440
It's their math skills

15
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,000
Biopsy's back on Gertrude

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,970
Lymphoma?

17
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,890
Not cancer

18
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,056
Non-caseating granulomas

19
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:32,040
That's good news

20
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,664
I'm waiting for one more test to come back 

21
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:35,440
and if the results are what I think they are, 

22
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,930
I'd like to deliver the news

23
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,330
Hi, Mrs Kovacc.

24
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,810
We have some news for you

25
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,436
Yeah?

26
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,590
Sarcoidosis

27
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,230
What's that?

28
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,470
It's very treatable

29
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,910
Does Dr. Chol agree?

30
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,910
Absolutely

31
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,670
What am I looking at?

32
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,430
The graph of your genetic makeup

33
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,270
You're part of African-American

34
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,155
What?

35
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:55,650
Come on, sister

36
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,170
Put it here

37
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:57,560
Give it here

38
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,400
we got to stick together

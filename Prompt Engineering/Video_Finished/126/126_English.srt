My best friend unexpectedly lost her dad almost 6 years ago. 

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,320
And for her wedding, 

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,840
I knew I wanted to somehow surprise her with a keepsake with her dad's remains

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,520
and I decided on a bouquet charm,

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,480
 so he could still walk her down the aisle. 

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,920
I've never before worked with the committed remains of someone I personally knew

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,120
while they were alive and i've never created a memorial this tiny. 

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,480
So this project was a huge deal for me. 

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,600
I went to her mom for her permission first

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,320
and she thought it was such a great idea

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,040
and really wanted me to go through with it. 

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,800
I first put some of his remains into a small pendant, 

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,400
and then I used her wedding colors to create a pearly marble design on top. 

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,550
And then I added a picture of them into the little keepsake box

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,910
her mom and I decided to give the charm to her

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,270
at the end of her rehearsal dinner with her fiance and brother there as well. 

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,270
and She loved it and kept it with her throughout her wedding the next day. 

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,910
This was such an important piece to me. 

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,670
So let me know what you think in the comments.

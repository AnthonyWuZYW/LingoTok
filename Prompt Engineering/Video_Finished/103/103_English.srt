1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,760
Do not die until 2040, 

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,680
unless you want to miss

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,600
these amazing space events. 

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,840
In 2027, we'll witness

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,440
the longest solar Eclipse

6
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,960
in 10,000 years

7
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,400
lasting about 6 minutes and 22 seconds

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,230
Then, in 2029,the asteroid apophysis

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,230
will pass alarmingly close to earth

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,415
just 35,000 kilometers away 

11
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,630
with a 2.4% chance of collision. 

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,150
According to some scientists, 

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,790
moving on to 2034 will experience

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,670
the stunning Leonard meteor shower

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,310
for a full 24 days, 

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,990
illuminating our night sky. 

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,310
Finally, in 2040 after 432 years, 

18
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,430
mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,495
and our moon will align 

20
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:42,070
all visible to the naked eye, 

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,070
Mark, these dates

22
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,910
on your calendar

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,110
and save this video

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,790
for more updates about space.

1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,840
Uh Live is all good, sir. 

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,200
Excellent work. 

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,440
Here's your oxygen

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,280
where to boss

5
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,520
just down there

6
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,040
and keep on going for this one. 

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,480
Any particular destination?

8
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,720
just write down. 

9
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,210
I kind of need to know the...

10
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,800
just down

11
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,460
just write down

12
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,340
yeah but what...

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,600
Down there?

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,850
look, we're sending everyone. 

15
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,930
It's all hands on deck, 

16
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,850
it's 7 o'clock in the morning. 

17
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,250
I'm just following orders. 

18
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,970
He hasn't even got anyone with him. 

19
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,160
yeah It's another false start I'm afraid.

20
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,610
what do we all need to go? 

21
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,320
I've got orders to send everyone

22
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,000
well who's going to look after the brain

23
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,320
not important right now. 

24
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,040
Honestly, 

25
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,920
these apes.

26
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,440
come on, 

27
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,400
you better get going, 

28
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,000
It's just embarrassing. 

29
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,410
You're a braver cell than me!

30
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,640
Poor guy

31
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,840
out of my way!

32
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm late!

33
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,360
I'm late!

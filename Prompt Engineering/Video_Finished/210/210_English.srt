1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,840
The Germans, 

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,600
there's the cliche, 

3
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,400
which is they have

4
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,400
no sense of humor. 

5
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,080
That's not a cliche. 

6
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,450
It's just 100% true. 

7
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,720
yeah well It's sort

8
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,960
of you know um

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,830
Germans. 

10
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,430
I hope I'm not hurting

11
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,510
anybody's feelings. 

12
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,790
No. 

13
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,470
It does go out on television. 

14
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,430
yeah Please speak. 

15
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:18,950
Thank you. 

16
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,570
I think Germans

17
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,890
is always go for a hit

18
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,850
on collision. 

19
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,990
and it's never .... it doesn't 

20
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,430
It rarely has sort

21
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,070
of grace and melody

22
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,030
and rhythm. 

23
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,910
It's just the ...

24
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,920
and I know, irony.

25
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,440
There's no sense

26
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,200
if they just say

27
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,720
exactly what they mean. 

28
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,650
Exactly, 

29
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,050
everything else is

30
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,050
dubious and slimy. 

31
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,090
It's the austrians

32
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,050
tend to make

33
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,480
their lives easier. 

34
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,570
So first of all, 

35
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,970
they are very polite. 

36
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,080
And second, 

37
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,080
they don't mean it. 

38
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,510
So....

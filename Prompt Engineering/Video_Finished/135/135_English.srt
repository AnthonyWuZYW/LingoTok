1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,720
Meeting someone online can feel strange at first. 

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,050
It's our natural instinct to shy away

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,010
but after seeing that person on screen day after day, 

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,960
that person suddenly feels familiar and a day without them feels..

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,900
like something is missing

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,320
The relationship may deep into the point

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,160
where someone is ready to say, 

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,160
I love you. 

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,970
But technology can only take a relationship so far. 

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,010
At some point, the only way for growth is to take the leap and actually meet in person. 

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,810
Are you ready to finally see Mira in person? 

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,880
And nothing beats that unforgettable moment

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,850
when you realize you've been cat fished, 

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,760
what happened today you completely ignored Mira. 

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,120
I thougt Mira was a cat. 

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,350
You thought Mira was a cat.

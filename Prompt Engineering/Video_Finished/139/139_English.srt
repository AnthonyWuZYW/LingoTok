1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,500
First day in Germany. 

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,190
Why is the supermarket closed? 

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,600
What?

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,960
shops are closed on Sundays? 

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,670
Why? 

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,660
That's crazy. 

7
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,140
1 week in Germany 

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,510
oh No, 

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,260
it's Sunday again. 

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,920
oh I don't have anything left to eat. 

11
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,700
How am I gonna eat groceries now? 

12
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,050
1 month in Germany

13
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,880
oh crap. 

14
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,280
Tomorrow is Sunday again, 

15
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,750
I gotta go get some food, 

16
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,760
oh half an hour until the supermarket closes

17
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,340
1 year in Germany. 

18
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,340
Sundays are so peaceful without the hassle of shopping. 

19
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,700
Kind of nice. 

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,720
Why don't more countries have this? 

21
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,980
10 years in Germany 

22
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,220
I can't imagine Sundays any other way. 

23
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,380
It's perfect. 

24
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,120
Everybody is at home, has time to meet friends. 

25
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,960
hey Honey, 

26
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,440
can you help me carry those boxes to the basement? 

27
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,680
Are you crazy? 

28
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,000
Sunday is "Ruhetag" 

29
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,310
nothing is to be worked

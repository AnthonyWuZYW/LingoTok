00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,440
Did you know that when cars are launched in a drag race, 

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,600
their tires get wrinkled. 

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,480
You see, 

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,280
dragsters are some of the fastest accelerating machines in the world

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,240
To give you an idea,

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,120
they're more powerful than 12 formula one cars combined. 

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,230
They use specialized soft tires with really low air pressure to maximize the grip. 

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,110
When launched with such an immense torque, 

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,070
these tires undergo serious wrinkling, 

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,190
causing their diameter to shrink by 8 inches. 

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,030
What's even more impressive is that as they pick up speed, 

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,830
their tires actually expand due to centrifugal force.

1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,320
Come shopping with me

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,600
at Ralph Lauren. 

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:03,450
Obviously, 

4
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,610
I was spoiled for choice, 

5
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,010
but it had to narrow it down. 

6
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,290
okay So this looked

7
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,210
beautiful off the hunger. 

8
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,570
But actually on, 

9
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,290
I don't think it

10
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,210
really flattered me. 

11
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,495
The material was 

12
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:14,810
gorgeous, obviously, 

13
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,770
but I don't think

14
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,050
it was very ..... WOW. 

15
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,200
But this, 

16
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,200
on the other hand, 

17
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,000
this doesn't even do it Justice. 

18
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,800
The colors

19
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,800
are so vibrant and beautiful. 

20
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,230
I would need a tailored, 

21
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,310
but it just looks so expensive. 

22
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,990
okay So this was a flop. 

23
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,590
It was way too revealing, 

24
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,590
in my opinion. 

25
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,430
And I just didn't know

26
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,590
how to tie the front. 

27
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,675
Again... I love the gorgeous 

28
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:36,910
colors of this. 

29
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,830
I feel like it flatters, 

30
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,350
my skin tone really well. 

31
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,620
But the actual court

32
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,420
not that flattering. 

33
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,260
Let me know in the comments

34
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,140
which one is your favorite. 

35
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,435
I have really been loving these 

36
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:50,530
rich vibrant colors recently. 

37
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,930
I'm obsessed.

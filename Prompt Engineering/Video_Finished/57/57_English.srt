00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,230
Part 3

00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,260
Common problems and mistakes. 

4
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,780
So you've found yourself a duck

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,110
But you find yourself chasing after it

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,680
It always runs away when you try to pick it up

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,432
Don't do this. 

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,670
If you're behind, 

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,250
that should remind

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,930
you that that's wrong. 

11
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,180
If you chase the duck, 

12
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,080
it will run. 

13
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,970
So get in front of the duck 

14
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,295
and introduce yourself 

15
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:25,770
and state your intentions. 

16
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,800
Hello, duck. 

17
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,980
My name is human name, 

18
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,056
and I'm going to pick you up now. 

19
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:33,665
Place your hand firmly underneath the duck 

20
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,380
Palm side-up and lift. 

21
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,770
Congratulations

22
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,960
You are now holding a duck

1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,200
Mi  Wu, this can of coke for you

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,360
It has no pull tab

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,400
oh I didn't noticed, 

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,730
can you still open it? 

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,830
Think it has no pull tap

6
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,550
Well, 

7
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,600
the opening of the can is very thin. 

8
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,760
I just need to keep some distance

9
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,200
and repeatedly rub the opening with a pen. 

10
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:12,880
So as to..

11
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,030
don't just drink. 

12
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,590
Have some jelly. 

13
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,750
You also got jelly. 

14
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,470
um? Where are the edges gone? 

15
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,440
absolutely not!

16
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,270
you know me. 

17
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,040
I got an idea, 

18
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,040
wipe the bottom and

19
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,430
give it a gentle bite. 

20
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,280
hey snacks are unhealthy

21
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,290
drink coconut water. 

22
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,730
Wow You even got a coconut for me. 

23
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,410
well Do you have a knife on you? 

24
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,810
Why would I keep a knife with me? 

25
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,930
I've got chopsticks

26
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,850
chopsticks. 

27
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,760
How can I make it? 

28
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,110
Let's see how you handle this. 

29
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,490
oh I got an idea. 

30
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,570
There is a soft spot

31
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:45,890
on the top of the coconut. 

32
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,210
that serves as a nutrient transfer point. 

33
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,610
So all you need to do is poke it in the center

34
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,730
and then explore around the area. 

35
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,550
You really think

36
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,390
you can open a coconut with the chopstick?

37
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,190
are't you a nice person?

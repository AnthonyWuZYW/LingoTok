1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,520
haw many languages. 

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,360
Do you speak? 

3
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:01,990
I don't know. 

4
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,780
3. 

5
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,140
That's what

6
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,540
the word

7
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,660
of a German, 

8
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,060
French, 

9
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,900
and English. 

10
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,390
And I fake Italian, 

11
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,750
and you fake Italian. 

12
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,790
What's the best? 

13
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,590
But if I wanted

14
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,770
to fake French, 

15
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,450
like... 

16
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:13,770
that that's

17
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,690
that's a hard one, 

18
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:14,970
right? 

19
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,490
Isn't it? 

20
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,450
unfakeable 

21
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,530
I understand it

22
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,650
more than I can...

23
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:18,870
Yeah, 

24
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,790
when I go there, 

25
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,455
I can... 

26
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:21,295
I speak it more than 

27
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:22,230
I understand. 

28
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:24,800
Also, 

29
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,960
French people are, 

30
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,320
they 

31
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,400
they're not flattered

32
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,030
by an attempt

33
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,910
to speak French. 

34
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,150
They actually hate

35
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,630
you more, 

36
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,235
they hate you more 

37
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:34,350
sometimes for good reason. 

38
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,100
But the the Italians

39
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,700
love it. 

40
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,300
yes If you stumble, 

41
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,660
you wave, 

42
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,460
ah they they love it, 

43
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,100
let they come

44
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,820
for the water. 

45
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,500
They love it. 

46
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,100
They got, 

47
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,300
at least he try. 

48
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,500
ah ... Whereas in France, 

49
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,980
they're like, 

50
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,110
no, 

51
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,710
they do they do. 

52
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,830
They do this. 

53
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:50,850
yeah 

54
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,840
And especially in Paris, 

55
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,940
and and I thought

56
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,860
last time I went

57
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,220
to Paris, 

58
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,860
someone did that. 

59
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,180
I thought

60
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,220
next time he does it, 

61
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,500
i'll break his finger off.

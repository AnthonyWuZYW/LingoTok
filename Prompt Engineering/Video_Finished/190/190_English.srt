1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,640
It's okay, 

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,160
come and see see

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,080
this yellow dot. 

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,880
Let's press it

5
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,680
gently with the key. 

6
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,840
You can see that I

7
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,920
can easily shift gears

8
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,600
without stepping

9
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,160
on the brake. 

10
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,760
In fact, 

11
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,680
your car has a lot

12
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,960
of emergency functions

13
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,030
today I will tell you

14
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,590
all you can like it, save it. 

15
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,030
First, 

16
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,990
our car key

17
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,430
is locked

18
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,190
in the car, 

19
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,070
then the car door

20
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,990
can't be opened, 

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,670
don't panic

22
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,470
at this time. 

23
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,010
Let me find a roll

24
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,590
of tape, 

25
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,040
stick it on the glass. 

26
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,350
The tape is already stuck 

27
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,350
next, we pull

28
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,550
the glass down hard. 

29
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,550
See the glass is lowered, 

30
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,390
take out the key

31
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,390
to unlock it. 

32
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,630
The car door will open. 

33
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,310
Second, 

34
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,990
we are driving

35
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,550
on the road. 

36
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,070
If the brakes suddenly fail, 

37
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,870
don't panic, 

38
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,910
we just need to hold

39
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,910
the electronic hand brake

40
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,430
and hold it, 

41
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,950
then the vehicle can stop steadily. 

42
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,330
Finally, 

43
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,830
we are trapped in the car 

44
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,700
and can't get out. 

45
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,200
We fold

46
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,200
down the rear seats

47
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,450
and climb into the trunk. 

48
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,320
Then find this mechanism

49
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,360
on the trunk door panel, 

50
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:54,960
just push

51
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,640
the trunk and it

52
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,320
will open. 

53
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,240
Have you learned it? 

54
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,040
Follow me to learn

55
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,840
some car knowledge

56
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,360
every day?

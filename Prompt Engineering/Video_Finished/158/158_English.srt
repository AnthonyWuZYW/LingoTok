1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,000
This is social media versus reality. 

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,105
First up is Venice, Italy ..

3
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:04,600
viewed as a romantic city

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,080
with historic architecture. 

5
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,040
And in reality, 

6
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,760
it is indeed a romantic place, 

7
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,640
but you might suffer

8
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,800
from flooding if you visit

9
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,720
in the wrong season. 

10
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,390
Next is Tianmen mountain

11
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,575
in China known as 

12
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:15,590
the stairway to heaven. 

13
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,190
While it offers stunning views

14
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,550
and thrilling glass skywalks. 

15
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,470
The reality often includes

16
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,830
large crowds and long wait times. 

17
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,670
Lastly is the troll Tonga rock

18
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,280
in Norway, 

19
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,360
shown as an adrenaline pumping adventure

20
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,480
with beautiful view. 

21
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,360
And in reality, 

22
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,045
this place is even more beautiful 

23
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:32,120
if you can hike the Top.

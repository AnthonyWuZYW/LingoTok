00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,520
Most people

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,280
don't understand

3
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,400
how deep the ocean really is. 

4
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,840
Imagine you walk off the coast

5
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,400
into the water at 10 meters

6
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,480
or 33 feet deep, 

7
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,840
you're already experiencing

8
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,190
an entire additional atmosphere

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,870
of pressure

10
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,950
at 214 meters. You're passing

11
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,830
the verified record for a human diver

12
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,750
with no equipment. 

13
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,630
At 830, you're the depth

14
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,950
of the tallest building on earth

15
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,630
and 1,000 meters down. 

16
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,030
No light from the surface

17
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,070
is getting to you anymore. 

18
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,230
And you're only about 1/10

19
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:25,990
of the way down, 

20
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,710
1220 meters. 

21
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:27,950
And you're

22
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,655
in the territory of the deepest 

23
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,275
military submarines that we know about 

24
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:32,470
at 3800 meters, 

25
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,430
you hit the Titanic. 

26
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,295
And just above it is where the infamous 

27
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:36,670
ocean gate submersible imploded. 

28
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,590
The deepest recorded natural point is

29
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,710
10,984 meters deep or 6.8 miles. 

30
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,670
You might have heard of this point. 

31
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,750
This is challenger deep. 

32
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,910
If you put Mount Everest

33
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,110
into the water upside down

34
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,870
there would still be over a Mile

35
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,990
until you got to the bottom. 

36
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,430
The ocean is just amazing. 

37
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,555
But the thing is we haven't 

38
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:54,870
mapped it very well. 

39
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,630
If you want to know more

40
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,790
about the crazy effort

41
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,990
to map our oceans, 

42
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,470

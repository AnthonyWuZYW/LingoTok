1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,080
Unbelievable. 

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:01,800
The inventor

3
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,560
of the RAM air turbine

4
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,760
is truly a genius. 

5
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,760
This device

6
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,520
only appears

7
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,400
when an aircraft

8
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:07,920
encounters

9
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,840
an emergency. 

10
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,270
The R8 consists

11
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,270
of 2 to 4 or 6 to 10 medium

12
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,990
length blades resembling

13
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,110
a ship's propeller. 

14
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,630
When both

15
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,670
the main engines

16
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,550
and auxiliary power systems

17
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,470
fail, 

18
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,470
the R8

19
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:21,910
becomes

20
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,910
the aircraft's

21
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,270
last lifeline. 

22
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,280
It automatically deploys

23
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:26,960
from the bottom

24
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,880
of the plane

25
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,040
using the airflow

26
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,440
generated during the planes

27
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,480
glide to spin and produce

28
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,720
electricity and hydraulic power. 

29
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,770
The faster the plane speed, 

30
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,450
the greater the R8s output

31
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,290
power. 

32
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,610
The R8s blades

33
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,610
can spin at a rate

34
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,570
of 5,000 to 7,000 revolutions

35
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,170
per minute, 

36
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,150
providing 5 to 70 kilovar

37
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,830
of power

38
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,270
and hydraulic power

39
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,230
for the landing gear

40
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,830
system. 

41
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,400
Although it

42
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,120
only produces

43
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,480
1/18 of the power

44
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,880
of a regular generator.

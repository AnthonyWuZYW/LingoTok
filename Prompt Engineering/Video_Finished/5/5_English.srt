1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,680
It starts off on an ocean slice where a young lady is using

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,760
her island laptop on the beach. 

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,190
Each key is a different music genre. 

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,870
My favorite is the lo fi island where you drink winter themed hot chocolate. 

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,710
In one cup. 

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,070
A woman sits with her morning coffee on her phone is a nice view from space. 

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,590
It takes a minute, 

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,230
but if you zoom far enough, 

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,510
you'll find a dorm room in that room. 

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,590
You'll find the setting for one of my web comics about a smartphone that

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,110
came to life and trapped four heroes. 

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,480
You can see them hanging out on one of the APP islands, 

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,760
looking up at the moon in the distance where another story is unfolding. 

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,240
This time set on a train where each car is a different biome. 

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,490
My favorite is the autumn cafe car. 

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,050
It has pretty good WiFi, 

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,770
so you can make calls or watch videos on your phone. 

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,950
Like this, one about a minecraft server centered around a holy rubis cube.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,510
On one of the tropical sites. 

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,710
I built a house. 

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,550
Here you could find me working on this weird drawing idea. 

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,470
I had about an ocean slice. 

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,920
This is the biggest drawing i've ever made.

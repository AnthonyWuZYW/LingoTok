1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,840
Making the paper disappear. 

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,560
This is gonna be hard, man. 

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,000
I don't know

4
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:04,840
how they're gonna match

5
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,880
like the little, 

6
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,400
like the shine on the orange, 

7
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,485
you see like throughout the 

8
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:09,080
whole oranges

9
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,500
like these little shines of light, 

10
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,860
I think that's impossible to match. 

11
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,220
So far I could do this. Okay? 

12
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,280
That's what I'm gonna

13
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,000
say right now. 

14
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,680
I could do what they've done up 

15
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,360
until this point. 

16
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,460
Right here is probably where they

17
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,860
lose my skill level. 

18
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,400
uh No, so far so good. 

19
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,840
okay yeah This is where we lose

20
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,400
my skill level. 

21
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,360
They are doing the shine. 

22
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,565
Look at it .. slowly, but surely 

23
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:35,500
this is so satisfying. 

24
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,500
Why is it so peaceful?!!

25
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,610
I could watch this for hours. 

26
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,610
It just feels so peaceful. 

27
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,700
i got to see the shine ... man, 

28
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,340
oh there they go, 

29
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,060
they add the shine, 

30
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,500
oh it looks so good. 

31
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,250
I feel like you can still see

32
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,090
like the the crust .. the peel

33
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,050
the peel, that's it. 

34
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,610
I saw I feel you could tell

35
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,330
at the peel.

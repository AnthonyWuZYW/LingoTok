1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,360
Watch, 

2
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,720
as this professor explains, 

3
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,640
life's most important philosophy. 

4
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,400
The ending is

5
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,280
truly eye opening. 

6
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,050
Is this jar full? 

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,416
yes

8
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:14,060
Is it full now? 

9
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,865
Yes 

10
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:21,920
and How about now? 

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,080
Is the jar full now? 

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,710
Yes. 

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,790
now I want you to recognize

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,990
this jar represents your life, 

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,130
golf balls. 

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,760
It is important things, 

17
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,440
your family, 

18
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,120
your friends, 

19
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,560
your health, 

20
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,680
and your passions. 

21
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,600
The pebbles are

22
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,680
the other important things

23
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,680
Your job, 

24
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,600
your home, 

25
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,940
the sand is

26
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,547
everything else 

27
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:42,740
it's just a small stuff. 

28
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:43,960
Now, 

29
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,080
if you put the sand in the jar first, 

30
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,960
you won't have room

31
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,640
for the pebbles

32
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,720
of the golf course. 

33
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,530
The same is true in life. 

34
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,150
You spend all your energy

35
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,750
and your time

36
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,830
on the small stuff 

37
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,010
You won't have time

38
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,410
for all the really important things

39
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,130
that matter to you.

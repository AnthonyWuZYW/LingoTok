1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,840
Come and spend

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,520
a day with me. 

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,080
So we have a fun day planned. 

4
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,320
I started off shopping, 

5
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,600
I had a browse around Ralph, 

6
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,640
and there were a few dresses I

7
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,480
want to try. 

8
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,800
And I also needs to get

9
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,405
some trousers tailored 

10
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:10,840
whilst I was there. 

11
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,500
This is option one. 

12
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,580
I thought it was cute, 

13
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,260
but it is giving milkmaid. 

14
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,300
So I decided not, 

15
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,340
but the shoes, 

16
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,060
on the other hand, 

17
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,380
are just divine. 

18
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,380
So obviously I

19
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,500
picked those up. 

20
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,230
After that strenuous activity, 

21
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,790
I needed a Starbucks, 

22
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,790
white chocolate mocha. 

23
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,750
Thank me later. 

24
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,710
We headed to Harrods

25
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,790
and just browsed

26
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,470
at the jewelry. 

27
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,870
And the chocolate hall

28
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,315
is literally my favorite 

29
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:33,830
place ever. 

30
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,640
After a day

31
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,760
of morning shopping, 

32
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,920
I really wants to go

33
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,600
to the gym, 

34
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,280
so I had to third space

35
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,550
and went for a quick dip

36
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,270
in the pool. 

37
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,255
This is literally my new 

38
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,070
favorite thing to do. 

39
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,150
But I had to rush

40
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,350
home and jump

41
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:46,870
on the train

42
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,630
to Cambridge

43
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,190
because I

44
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,950
was planning to meet

45
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,950
my best friends. 

46
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,670
How cute sit here by the way. 

47
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,870
And here's Laura, 

48
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,870
she's so adorable. 

49
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,390
We headed

50
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,510
to the Shakespeare festival

51
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,870
to see

52
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,630
our best friend form pepper

53
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,070
and she was insane, 

54
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,950
it was so wholesome.

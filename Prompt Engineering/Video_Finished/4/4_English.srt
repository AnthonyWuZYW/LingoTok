00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,720
Do you ever look at someone and wonder what is going on inside their head? 

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,280
This is joy coming to you live in Riley's mind, 

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,480
make some noise. 

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,560
This is in the house. 

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,760
It's anger. 

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,720
Love me, Adam.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,350
We gotta get our mouth guard. 

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,510
People, fear.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,310
No, that's not ours,

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,390
disgust. 

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,430
Glad to have her on our team who made the console orange. 

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,350
Do I look orange? 

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,350
I didn't touch orange is not my color at me. 

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,390
Hello, everybody.

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,430
I'm anxiety. 

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,790
Where can I put my stuff? 

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,830
A new emotion? 

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,670
Sorry, we wanted to make such a good first impression.

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,710
What do you mean? 

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,310
We I'm envy, 

21
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,950
Look at your hair.

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,230
Oh yeah not happening.

23
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,704
That's on we,on what?

24
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:51,080
It's what you would call the boredom.

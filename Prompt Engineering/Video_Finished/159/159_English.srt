1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,040
For the love of god, 

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,880
don't do these things. 

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,000
When you come to Japan, 

4
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,200
there are so many things

5
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,520
you don't want to do on the train. 

6
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,125
But one thing no one talks about 

7
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,000
is the sneaky out of service train. 

8
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,480
If no one gets on it, when it stops, 

9
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,840
so everybody gets off

10
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,560
suddenly then don't make the mistake. 

11
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,880
I've made so many times

12
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,120
and just follow the crowd. 

13
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,200
Then when it's time to get on, 

14
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,400
put your backpack in the front, 

15
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,160
when it's crowded, 

16
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,720
get your spot and be quiet, 

17
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,070
or if you don't want to rawdog, 

18
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,910
the train ride get your earphones ready. 

19
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,110
Also don't use the train

20
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,910
like a jungle gym. 

21
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,070
I've seen tourists use these

22
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,950
like monkey bars, 

23
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,040
and If that's too complicated, 

24
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,080
then you can get a taxi, 

25
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,640
but don't miss open taxis

26
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,040
because the colors are reversed. 

27
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,080
Green means taken

28
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,440
and red means available. 

29
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,000
Also don't ignore the colors

30
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,920
on vending machines. 

31
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,180
The blue ones are called drinks, 

32
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,460
and red ones are hot drinks. 

33
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,300
These can be really useful as hand warmers

34
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,140
in the winter and cooling packs

35
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,780
in the summer, 

36
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,820
which the heat and humidity in Japan, 

37
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,620
June through September is so bad. 

38
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,670
All I have to say is do not come

39
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,310
instead come with us in October. 

40
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,790
When we're hosting a group tour, 

41
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,310
we're going to Kyoto, Osaka, 

42
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,070
and even to feed

43
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,950
the deer in Nara, 

44
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,510
there are still spots open now.

1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,440
Siri

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,000
will understand

3
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,160
your personal context

4
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,120
working across apps

5
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,640
to help you get

6
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:03,960
more done

7
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,840
like finding Information

8
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,560
in your photos. 

9
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,240
Siri found

10
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,440
my glasses prescription, 

11
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,640
nailed it. 

12
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,840
oh This is cool. 

13
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,760
Siri also has

14
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,120
richer language understanding, 

15
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,560
meaning you

16
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,680
can speak to it more naturally, 

17
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,160
and it will know

18
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:16,400
what you're

19
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,280
talking about. 

20
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,540
Siri, 

21
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,180
can you find

22
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:19,780
that pod cast? 

23
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,220
I would. 

24
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:20,980
I mean

25
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,330
that song Brian sent me.

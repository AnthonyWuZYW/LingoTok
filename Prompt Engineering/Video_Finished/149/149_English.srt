1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,600
You want to keep

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,560
the small blueberries

3
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,640
throw away the big ones, 

4
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,840
keep the big raspberries, 

5
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,960
throw away the small ones, 

6
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,410
take the small blueberry, 

7
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,130
squeeze it

8
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,690
into the big raspberry. 

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And then you want to freeze these. 

10
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,190
Once frozen, you're

11
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,030
going to melt

12
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,230
some white chocolate

13
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,470
over a dull boiler. 

14
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,370
Until nice and smooth, 

15
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:17,930
then you take

16
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,530
your frozen raspberry. 

17
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,585
chuck it into the white chocolate 

18
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:22,820
coat it all over. 

19
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,710
With the fork, 

20
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,030
shake off the excess, 

21
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,620
put it back in the freezer, 

22
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,040
freeze it up again. 

23
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,240
And now you take

24
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,140
some dark chocolate

25
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,260
or some milky chocolate

26
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,850
and coat it again, 

27
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,570
shake off the excess. 

28
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,540
and There you go

29
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,340
back in the freezer

30
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,580
and you got this amazing, 

31
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,290
little frozen fruit treat for summer.

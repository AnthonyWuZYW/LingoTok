1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,600
Study people who eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables could reduce

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,960
the risk of heart and kidney disease. 

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,200
Researchers took more than 150 people with high blood pressure who were

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,020
at risk for kidney disease and divided them into 3 groups. 

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,490
1 group added 2 to 4 cups of fruits and veggies to their diet. 

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,770
Each day, another added two daily doses of baking soda,

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,410
and one continued with standard medical care. 

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,820
The study found that after 5 years, 

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,990
the first two diets promoted kidney health, 

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,200
but the fruit and vegetable diet improved heart health as well. 

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,470
The american Heart Association recommends 4 to 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day

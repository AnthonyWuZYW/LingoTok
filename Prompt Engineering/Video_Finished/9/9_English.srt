00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,920
Everyone nowadays believes in education, 

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,520
we train kids to do maths, 

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,040
we teach pilots how to land planes and surgeons, 

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,680
how to operate on our brains. 

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,120
But there's one area where we don't seem to believe in education. 

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,470
At all, we just leave people to figure out themselves life itself.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,830
There's an odd silence in education when it comes to the truly big questions, 

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,020
who should we get together with? 

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,870
How can you manage a relationship? 

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,990
What career are you suited to? 

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,350
What's money for? 

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,200
How can we manage anxiety? 

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,280
And what do we do with regret and shame? 

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,320
What do we do about illness and aging? 

15
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,190
How do we deal with our families? 

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,720
Here there is very strangely often no one to turn to nowhere to go. 

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,960
So stress accumulates and disasters occur.

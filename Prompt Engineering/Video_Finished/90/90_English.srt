1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,845
This is by far the most difficult 

2
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:02,440
and detailed cake

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,360
that i've ever made. 

4
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,200
So a lot of you

5
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:04,760
wanted to see me

6
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,640
make SpongeBob. 

7
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,840
And I was a little hesitant

8
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,360
to do this one, 

9
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,800
because I knew how complicated

10
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,520
it would be, 

11
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,080
but I was

12
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,880
up for the Challenge. 

13
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,360
So I sacked the cake up. 

14
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,830
I covered that with chocolate garnish, 

15
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,190
and then I'm

16
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,310
going to decorate this cake, 

17
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,390
use a modeling chocolate. 

18
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,070
And the hardest thing

19
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,310
about this is that I'm turning

20
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,350
a 2-D character into a 3-D cake. 

21
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,830
And that's a really difficult thing

22
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,230
to do. 

23
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,830
So I have to look at so many pictures

24
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,430
of SpongeBob

25
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,670
from all different size

26
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,110
just to make

27
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,670
sure that I had

28
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,470
all the proportions. 

29
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:27,750
Great. 

30
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,150
And once I

31
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,470
finished

32
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,430
with his facial features, 

33
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,950
I still had

34
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,390
other things

35
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,830
to model

36
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,510
like his legs, 

37
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,070
his shoes, 

38
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,030
and also his arms, 

39
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,670
which I held

40
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,430
into place using

41
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,710
wire. 

42
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,470
And now some add

43
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:35,750
color

44
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,350
to this cake. 

45
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,110
And I'm doing this

46
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,710
by using

47
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,430
a combination

48
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,430
of both edible paint and air brushing, 

49
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,750
because I

50
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,310
wanted to add

51
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,110
as much detail

52
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,550
to this cake

53
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,630
that I possibly could. 

54
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,230
And this is

55
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,790
the part that

56
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,510
is really fun, 

57
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,390
but it is difficult. 

58
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,110
I'm just trying to make

59
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,510
sure that I

60
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:47,910
don't miss

61
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,470
anything up

62
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,950
at this point. 

63
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,610
And I finished

64
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,890
all the last details by using

65
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,250
different colored modeling chocolate

66
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,010
to make his teeth, 

67
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,490
his tie in his eyelashes, 

68
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,130
and that makes

69
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,570
this SpongeBob cake Complete. 

70
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm sponge Bob.

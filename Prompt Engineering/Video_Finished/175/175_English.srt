1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,560
You have a problem? Yes, I do. 

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,400
I've had a long day. 

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,760
Is it too much to ask for a dinner with a little peace and quiet? 

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,720
Sheldon, you do not talk to your father like that.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,240
Fine. 

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,360
I'd rather not speak to any of you. 

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,590
I got this.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,430
George, maybe you should calm down. 

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:15,790
First. 

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,870
I got this. 

11
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,390
You want to explain yourself. 

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,390
I'd rather just go to bed since I have to be up in a few hours. 

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,950
Anyway. 

14
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,710
I understand you're tired, but that is no reason.

15
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,990
I'm not just tired. 

16
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,530
I'm exhausted. 

17
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,690
Everything hurts. 

18
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,890
I get up in the morning to do this job I don't even like,

19
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,570
and I'm doing it just for the money, 

20
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,050
and it's not even a lot of money. 

21
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,410
I keep trying harder and harder, 

22
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,770
and it doesn't even make a difference? 

23
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,610
So you're going to yell at me or punish me. 

24
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,810
Let's just get it over with. 

25
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,290
I won't punish you. 

26
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,330
Why not? 

27
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,920
I deserve it

28
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,820
Let me tell you about my day. 

29
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,750
I got yelled at by the principal for benching a linebacker who was flunking English. 

30
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,680
Then I got yelled at even more by the kid's parents. Then I had to break up the fight in the locker room, got elbowed in the neck. 

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,390
That's a rough day. 

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,100
It was all before 10:00 am. So I get what you're going through. 

33
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,200
But you notice, I didn't come home and take it out on you.

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,110
No, you didn't.

35
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,550
I want you get back in there. 

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,070
Apologize to everyone,

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,590
and finish your dinner, sir.

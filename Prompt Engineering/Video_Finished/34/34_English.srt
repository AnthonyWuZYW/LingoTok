1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,680
Cristiano Ronaldo is the only footballer that became a better player. 

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,880
After he turned 30. 

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,480
Before Cristiano Ronaldo turned 30, 

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,960
he scored 463 goals in 718 matches. 

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,470
He had just two Ballon doors, 

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,070
zero international trophies, 

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,150
and two Champions League trophies. 

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,630
But after he turned 30, 

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,830
he scored 361 goals in 430 matches. 

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,190
He won three extra ballon doors, 

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,830
two international trophies, 

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,470
and three extra Champions League trophies. 

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,710
It's just crazy to know that.

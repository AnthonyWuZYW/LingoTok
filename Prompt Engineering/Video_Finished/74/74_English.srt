1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,410
Excuse me, ma'am,

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,410
did you drop your purse? 

3
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,490
oh Thank you. 

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,210
No problem. 

5
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,310
Your necklace. 

6
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,180
Where did you get that uh when I was a kid? 

7
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,900
My best friend gave this to me, 

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,100
but he disappeared on a hiking trip. 

9
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,340
Most people say he probably got eaten by a bear, 

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,770
Kevin. 

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,090
No, 

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,690
I'm Jay. 

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,050
I found this in a pile of bear poop. 

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,170
Your friend Kevin definitely got eaten by a bear. 

15
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,770
That's crazy.

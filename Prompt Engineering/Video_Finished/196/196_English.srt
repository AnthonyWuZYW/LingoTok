1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,680
Pretending

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,320
my girlfriend

3
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,000
mistreats me

4
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,520
in front

5
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,000
of my girlfriend's parents, 

6
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:04,360
babe, 

7
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,600
can I eat? 

8
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,150
Yeah, you.

9
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,070
Thank you, baby.

10
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,750
I love you. 

11
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,500
What are you eating? 

12
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:11,820
Michelle? 

13
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,300
yeah 

14
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,700
I always have to eat

15
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,580
her leftovers. 

16
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,140
That's what she

17
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,020
said before. 

18
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,620
I know this one really. 

19
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,960
oh thank you 

20
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,800
Thank you, 

21
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,640
eat everything. 

22
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,020
okay Thanks. 

23
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,080
of course This is

24
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,400
not the end of it. 

25
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,130
babe here's your tea

26
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,890
after the dinner. 

27
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,310
Tea. 

28
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,550
yeah 

29
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,390
Why are you kneeling down?! 

30
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,590
she told me that I

31
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,590
need to kneel down to do

32
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,070
everything for her. 

33
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,890
That's the rule

34
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,090
in the relationship. 

35
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,810
What is it? 

36
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,520
Come over. 

37
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,900
You need to talk

38
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,280
the tea taste so good.

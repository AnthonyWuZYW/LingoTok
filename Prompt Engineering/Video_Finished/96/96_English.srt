00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,240
The two greatest mysteries

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,640
in all of science, 

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,000
in all of science, 

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,520
the two greatest mysteries

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,440
are of one. 

6
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,360
What happened before creation?! 

7
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,720
Why did we have a Big Bang?!

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,520
What banged?! ... 

9
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,880
Are there other universe is a multiverse

10
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,160
before the Big Bang

11
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,450
That's outer space. 

12
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,930
Then the second mystery...

13
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,050
is inner space. 

14
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,315
yes 

15
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:23,570
what goes on behind your eyeballs?!

16
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,090
We have 100 billion neurons

17
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,630
in your brain, 

18
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,550
as many as stars, 

19
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,390
in the Milky Way Galaxy. 

20
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,360
Each neuron is connected

21
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,640
to 10,000 other neurons. 

22
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,320
And so what is the brain?!!!

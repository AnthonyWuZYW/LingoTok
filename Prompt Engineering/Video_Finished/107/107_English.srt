1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,160
A big misconception

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:01,840
about blindness

3
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,600
is that everyone

4
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,280
who is blind

5
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,680
sees like this. 

6
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,950
In reality, 

7
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,070
blindness is a spectrum

8
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,190
and only a small percentage

9
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,390
see nothing at all, 

10
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,815
tends to be more like these 

11
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:12,150
visual impairment examples. 

12
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,910
First one, here is diabetic retinopathy, 

13
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,230
which affects about 9.6 million people

14
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,390
in the United States

15
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,020
Next up here, we have an example

16
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,780
of a severe form of cataracts. 

17
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,580
It affects about 20 million people

18
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,820
in the United States

19
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,260
but is highly treatable. 

20
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,850
Next up here, we have glaucoma, 

21
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,250
which affects about 3 million americans, 

22
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,690
and is the second leading cause

23
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,290
of blindness worldwide. 

24
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:34,960
Next up here, 

25
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,400
we have macular degeneration, 

26
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,280
which affects about 20 million people

27
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,960
in the United States

28
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,480
Next up here is

29
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,880
an example of what it might be

30
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,600
like for somebody who can only see

31
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,960
lights and shadows

32
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,200
and not much else.

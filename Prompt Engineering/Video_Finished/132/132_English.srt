00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,720
What if the moon collided with earth? 

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,520
And would it cause the death of everyone？

click the subscribe button 

4
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,800
and let's find out

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,480
the moon helps maintain earth's gravitational pull. 

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,600
and because of the moon, 

7
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,320
earth's gravity stays balanced. 

8
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,870
The moon is 30084,000 kilometers away from earth. 

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,270
This might sound like a lot. 

10
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,590
But if the moon started moving towards earth at a rate of 5,000 kilometersper day, 

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,990
it would reach us in just 75 days

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,790
as the moon begins to approach earth，

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,750
Earth's gravity will start to weaken

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,590
when the moon is about 200,000 kilometers away, 

15
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,790
the ocean tides will rise dramatically. 

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,790
Leading to tsunamis all around the world. 

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,870
And countries located below sea level will start to flood

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
as the moon gets even closer to earth. 

19
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,600
We will start to experience daily earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. 

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,600
When the moon is only 6,000 kilometers away from earth, 

21
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,520
our atmosphere will tear the moon into thousands of pieces, 

22
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,430
which will then begin to orbit around earth. 

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,550
This event would result in the death of most people on earth.

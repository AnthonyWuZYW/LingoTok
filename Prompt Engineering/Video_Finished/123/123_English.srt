1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,640
The trap that most people fall for is when they speak, 

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,480
they get stuck

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,200
in a default rate of speech. 

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,380
I'll be dramatic here. 

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,890
I get stuck at a two watch what happens to your brains automatically. 

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,420
If I just, hi, everyone, 

7
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,240
it's great to be here. 

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,290
You start to feel a pain. 

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,130
so If you get stuck in a slow default rate of speech, 

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,290
not influential, 

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,170
nor is it impact full. 

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,800
But then again,  

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,650
I used to do this because I'm part Vietnamese, 

14
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,490
and I speak really quickly. 

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,370
I'm really good to be here. 

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,730
Can't wait to take you through vocal foundation. 

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,130
It's going to be amazing. 

18
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,580
You're thinking, 

19
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,820
do Asian and south Australians breathe? 

20
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,820
Really interesting now, 

21
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,380
because if we go to about a six, 

22
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,380
hi,  everyone really excited to be here to take you

23
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,780
through the vocal foundations

24
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,940
for the next couple of days. 

25
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,500
And as we learned the vocal foundations, 

26
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,780
what you start to realize in your own head

27
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,760
is what starts started out

28
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,640
as being really engaging 

29
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,040
after a while

30
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,160
becomes monotonous. 

31
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,790
Isn't that weird? 

32
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,910
Because then you're thinking

33
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,070
well what the Frick do I do. 

34
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,830
Then this is where you learn the importance of variety. 

35
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,750
Vocal variety is key.

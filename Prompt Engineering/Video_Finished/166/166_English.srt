00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,280
Welcome back to the series

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,360
where we saw things

3
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,280
the wrong way. 

4
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,560
This item is

5
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,945
this really wacky 

6
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:07,000
Halter top. 

7
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,145
She looks like ..

8
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:09,080
how you're supposed to

9
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,840
 wear it on. 

10
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,760
We have it on

11
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,720
like a necklace, 

12
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,510
have this chain

13
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,470
and I'm gonna slip it through. 

14
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,510
And now it's kind

15
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,950
of like a strap

16
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,750
in the back. 

17
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,560
Have this like halter top, 

18
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,640
but it's backless, 

19
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,400
it's still gonna add

20
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,520
on these trousers

21
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,480
can match the vibes

22
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,440
of the Top. 

23
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,000
They were starting

24
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,960
in with the halter top. 

25
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,480
I'm just putting

26
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,320
it on backwards

27
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,945
to see if it works 

28
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,510
is giving modern elegance. 

29
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,070
So I think we're

30
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,710
gonna have to go

31
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,630
with some gold jewelry. 

32
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,430
me and my boyfriend yesterday

33
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,150
we're actually thinking

34
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,710
about going to New York

35
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,830
for just a day ..

36
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,030
literally just a day. 

37
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,950
We didn't get 

38
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,430
a little New York breeze

39
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,910
up our sleeve

40
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,470
you know what I mean. 

41
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,230
And now we're gonna go

42
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,190
in for the shoes. 

43
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,755
It's probably way too cold 

44
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,190
outside where you

45
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,510
live to just go

46
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,750
bare arm like this. 

47
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,100
And then for bag, 

48
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,690
yeah this outfit

49
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,010
is just too good. 

50
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,890
And as always.

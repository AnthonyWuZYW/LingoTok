1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:02,566
travel the world with a camera and all my friends

2
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:03,600
and I'm gonna show you guys

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,400
what 2023 looked like for me

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,666
in January I took a flight to Belize

5
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,733
and backpacked through the coastal islands

6
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,100
before making my way into Guatemala

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,700
this is where I crossed something off my bucket list

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,666
of climbing an active volcano

9
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,466
jumping off rope swings into

10
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:21,666
crocodile infested waters and exploring ancient cities

11
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,600
I then flew to Japan almost immediately after

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,566
on a 200 dollar one way ticket

13
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:27,766
I was lucky enough to see

14
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,333
Mount Fuji for three days straight while I was there

15
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,333
after a few weeks

16
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,933
my buddy and I hopped on another

17
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,200
one way flight to Chang Mai Thailand

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,966
upon arriving

19
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:38,566
we met a couple of Swedish guys in our hostel

20
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,500
and after just one night of hanging out

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,966
we decided to travel together

22
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:43,166
for the coming weeks

23
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,333
our friend group grew to almost 15

24
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,300
people when we were all traveling together

25
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,533
Thailand was stunning

26
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,533
but it was time to get back to the United States for an American summer

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,333
I spent four weeks

28
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,200
traveling up the California coast with my buddy Caleb

29
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,800
before meeting up with the rest of the

30
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,066
crew in Southern Oregon

31
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,666
on one of our first days together

32
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:00,800
a

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,566
blizzard struck and we decided to play a baseball game

34
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,166
for two months straight we did new things every day

35
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,966
hiking to the tops of mountains

36
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,166
setting up trampolines on docks and piers

37
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,333
and even rollerblading

38
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,700
through America's most pristine mountains

39
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,100
fall came quicker than ever

40
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,566
and we were on to our next mission

41
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:17,866
we all flew to Peru

42
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:18,866
and for four weeks

43
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,566
we saw some of the country's most incredible sights

44
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:24,100
and explored one of the seven wonders of the world

45
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,566
then we got the sudden urge to go to Costa Rica

46
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,700
I ate more tacos than I could imagine

47
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,033
and I got sick

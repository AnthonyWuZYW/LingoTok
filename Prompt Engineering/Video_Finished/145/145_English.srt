1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,390
Why do all the airplanes

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,870
in the world

3
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,750
avoid flying

4
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,630
over this zone? 

5
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,560
This zone is

6
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,640
quite huge more than 5 times

7
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,640
the size of France. 

8
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,280
And if we look

9
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,120
at a flight radar, 

10
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,760
we can see

11
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,880
an extensive area

12
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,040
empty of airplanes. 

13
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,130
This is the Tibetan plateau. 

14
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,730
There are

15
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,770
three main reasons

16
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,210
why planes do not fly here. 

17
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:17,820
Firstly, 

18
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,180
Tibet is the highest plateau

19
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:19,740
in the world

20
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,100
with an average elevation

21
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,460
of about 14,800 feet. 

22
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,540
It is home to some

23
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,460
of the highest mountains

24
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,100
on the planet, 

25
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,540
including Mount Everest, 

26
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,460
commercial aircraft

27
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,040
have to fly

28
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,880
at an altitude

29
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,720
of about 33,000 feet, 

30
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,200
but in case

31
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,080
of an emergency

32
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,360
such as a cabin depressurization, 

33
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,320
they need to quickly descend

34
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,560
to 10,000 feet

35
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,480
which is almost impossible in Tibet

36
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,600
because of its height. 

37
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,390
Secondly, 

38
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,790
the weather conditions in Tibet

39
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,510
are often extremely unpredictable, 

40
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,010
strong winds, 

41
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,050
turbulence and sudden weather changes

42
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,855
make flying over this region 

43
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:50,890
dangerous and challenging. 

44
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,570
Finally, 

45
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,570
the third reason

46
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,130
is the lack

47
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,210
of sufficient airports

48
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,250
for emergency landings

49
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,810
in the area. 

50
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,130
There are

51
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,130
only five airports

52
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,390
in Tibet making flights

53
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,950
over this region extremely risky.

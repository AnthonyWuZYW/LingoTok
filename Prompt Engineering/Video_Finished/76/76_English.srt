1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,065
Have you ever noticed that earth appears .. 

2
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:02,920
to be dripping

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,185
like almost every glob of land ..

4
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:07,480
tapers off in the same direction ..

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,465
like all of its melting and running down south ..

6
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:12,160
to pool at the bottom

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,800
well .. a lot of people have, 

8
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,105
it's called continental drip 

9
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:17,080
and it's real. 

10
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,760
Lee just a coincidence. 

11
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,960
We just happen to be alive. 

12
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,840
When earth happens to look like this. 

13
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,885
Our brains have a tendency to find 

14
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:24,805
meaningful connections ..

15
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:26,120
in unrelated things. 

16
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,360
It's called "apothenia", 

17
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,040
but when it involves images and sounds, 

18
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,720
it's called "paradigm". 

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,950
It's how we notice that Italy looks like a boot. 

20
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,790
The Nile looks like Vietnam, 

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,110
Namibia, and Zimbabwe, 

22
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,670
look like the creation of Adam. 

23
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,350
The Americas look like a duck. 

24
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,310
Finland looks like a waving woman. 

25
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,150
Australia looks like cat dog. 

26
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,555
And even though it actually broke from Antarctica 

27
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:46,470
a 100 million years ago, 

28
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,550
somehow also fits into the east coast of the USA. 

29
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,175
It's also why we can rearrange 

30
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:53,190
earth's land masses to look like a mouse

31
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,390
or a cow ..... or a chicken, 

32
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,270
even a fire, breathing, t-rex.

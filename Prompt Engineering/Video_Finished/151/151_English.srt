1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,760
Have you ever wondered

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,040
how massive oil rigs 

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,080
are constructed in the middle

4
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,920
of the deep ocean? 

5
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,800
well .. The ocean's depth

6
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,680
is pretty staggering. 

7
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,240
The deepest point ever recorded

8
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,320
by humans is 6.8 miles. 

9
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,280
If you put Mount Everest

10
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,350
up upside down in the ocean

11
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,710
there would still be over a Mile

12
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,750
until you get to the bottom. 

13
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,230
so How is it possible to build

14
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,150
these mega structures 

15
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,190
in the midst of all this

16
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,030
where waves can be

17
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,710
as tall as a 10-story building? 

18
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,110
Some people even jokingly say

19
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,230
that they build the oil rigs

20
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,070
first and then build the ocean

21
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,590
around them. 

22
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,870
You see, 

23
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,950
in shallow waters, 

24
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,310
fixed steel structures

25
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,630
are installed in the ocean floor, 

26
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,870
but for the deeper waters, 

27
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,630
floating platforms are used that

28
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,110
are anchored

29
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,550
securely to the ocean floor.

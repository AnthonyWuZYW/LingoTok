1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,085
Who said dogs are loyal 

2
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:01,920
and cats are selfish. 

3
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,400
Cats are your hero in five ways. 

4
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:03,760
One, 

5
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,640
if you take your cat

6
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,320
for a walk and it

7
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,680
suddenly becomes aggressive, 

8
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,960
don't hesitate, just run. 

9
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,165
A girl in China stopped her 

10
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:09,825
evening stroll because 

11
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:10,640
her cat kept hissing. 

12
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,160
It turned out that two murders happened 

13
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,390
in the that location that day, 

14
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,430
cats can hear the footsteps

15
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,510
of predator from hundreds

16
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,670
of meters away and cats let

17
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,750
their owners know about danger

18
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,510
by showing alert, 

19
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:18,790
two. 

20
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,190
If your cat suddenly try searching

21
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,550
for a hiding spot or even arching

22
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,350
its back at nothing, 

23
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,150
quickly take your cat

24
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,830
to a safe place. 

25
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,490
Cats often exhibit these behaviors

26
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,610
about 10 to 30 minutes

27
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,690
before an earthquake occurs. 

28
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,330
And that has saved

29
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,130
many cat owners. 

30
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,530
Three, 

31
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,355
if your cat starts being more cleaning and 

32
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:32,490
protective towards the female owner

33
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,490
like not allowing others to get close, 

34
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,370
then the female owner

35
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,090
might be pregnant, 

36
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,435
Four, 

37
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:37,290
if your cat keeps scratching

38
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,230
at the door or make

39
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,630
unusual noises to wake you up

40
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,310
at night, but it's

41
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,350
not their usual behavior. 

42
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:41,910
You should check

43
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,110
for gas leaks or intruders. 

44
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,190
It's very likely that they

45
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,030
have sensed something

46
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,150
and are trying to alert you. 

47
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,695
Five, 

48
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:47,470
if your cat becomes

49
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,630
much more attached to you

50
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,470
and more frequently rubs

51
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,840
against furniture or corners. 

52
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,880
The cat makes sense that it's

53
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,840
near the end of its life

54
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,920
by leaving it sent on you

55
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,680
in the surrounding. 

56
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,520
Your cat wants to tell

57
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,720
other cats that you are a human

58
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,800
with the cat's protection

59
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,400
and should not be messed with.

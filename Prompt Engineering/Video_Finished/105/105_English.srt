1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,250
When the woman woke up, 

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,950
she found an owl perched

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,030
on her windowsill, 

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,590
holding a letter in its beak, 

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,430
reminiscent of a magical scene

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,790
from Harry Potter

7
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,370
However, when the woman 

8
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,610
tried to take the letter, 

9
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,680
the owl refused to let go. 

10
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,270
so She turned around and went

11
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,870
inside to get a toy mouse, 

12
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,710
attempting to trade with the owl, 

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,590
but it still wouldn't release the letter. 

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,960
Finally, after trying another toy, 

15
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,250
when she attempted to take the letter again, 

16
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,270
the owl finally relented. 

17
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,000
As a token of gratitude, 

18
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,240
the woman decided to give 

19
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,600
the toy to the owl. 

20
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,840
In fact, this owl would visit

21
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,800
the woman's windowsill every day. 

22
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,470
Her cat curious about the visitor likely mistook

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,550
it for a monster. When the owl

24
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,070
turned its head, the cat

25
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,710
was so frightened that it ran away, 

26
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,990
looking quite comical. 

27
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,610
The owl itself seemed

28
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,490
quite puzzled by the whole ordeal. 

29
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,960
The reason the owl visited

30
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,760
the window every day was that the woman

31
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,640
had once saved it when it was young. 

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,150
Therefore, it would come

33
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,830
to visit her, perhaps as a way

34
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,950
to express gratitude.

00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,920
Have you ever seen your cat wiggle before bouncing? 

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,280
It's a common sight among cats, 

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,840
especially when they're preparing to chase after a toy or hunt prey. 

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,000
Even if it's just a playful interaction with the toy, 

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,080
First, they do it to check balance or traction. 

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,496
Cats need to make sure they have a good grip on the ground before they jump. 

7
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:13,970
Just like when runners get ready to sprint.

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,890
Cats need to feel steady before they make their move. 

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,136
The wiggle helps them feel confident 

10
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:18,490
that they won't slip or fall when they leap.

11
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,090
Second, over excitement. 

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,890
Before they pounce, 

13
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,090
cats get really excited. 

14
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,776
It's like when you're about to do something super fun. 

15
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,072
And you can't wait any longer. 

16
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:27,590
The wiggle is their way of showing that they're pumped up and ready to go. 

17
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,670
It's like a signal that says, 

18
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,510
I'm so excited. Let's do this. 

19
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,950
Take note that the wiggle before a pounce

20
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,030
is different than a cat rubbing its bottom after pooping.

21
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,480
Just like this smart cat right here, 

22
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,685
The wiggle is instinctual 

23
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:39,200
while rubbing the bottom is simply because the cat feels uncomfortable. 

24
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,720
And when I annoy you by making your bed sheet of tissue paper.

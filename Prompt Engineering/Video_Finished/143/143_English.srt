1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,625
This girl 

2
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:01,605
is the world's best 

3
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:02,200
makeup artists

4
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:02,720
in the world. 

5
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:02,960
And you

6
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,325
can easily see why 

7
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:05,040
every single time

8
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,880
she puts on makeup, 

9
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,885
she creates an absolutely 

10
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:08,840
insane illusion. 

11
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,240
So you

12
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:09,800
can't even tell

13
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,840
which part is

14
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,885
real or fake 

15
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:12,320
like in this one. 

16
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,310
it looks like she has

17
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,470
2 pairs of eyes. 

18
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,830
But in the very next one, 

19
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,435
it looks like 

20
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:17,470
her entire face

21
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,510
is made out of glass. 

22
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,430
And although these ones

23
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,270
are mind blowing, 

24
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,950
you won't believe

25
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,550
how good number 16 is, 

26
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,150
but this one

27
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,710
makes it look

28
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,180
like her entire face is

29
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,740
just one giant mouth, 

30
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,100
and you

31
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,140
can't even tell

32
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,980
until she opens

33
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,620
her eyes. 

34
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,700
So that just shows

35
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,300
how good her

36
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,540
skills really are. 

37
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,100
But the amount

38
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,900
of practice she

39
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,860
needed to do these

40
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,630
must have been

41
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,150
a ton

42
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,390
since only a professional

43
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,670
would be

44
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,190
able to do it

45
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,910
like she does. 

46
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,430
But while some

47
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,830
of them are

48
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,270
like an optical illusion, 

49
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,710
others are

50
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,150
just really good positioning

51
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,630
and lighting. 

52
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,190
But this one

53
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,710
makes it look

54
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,190
like her face

55
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,510
is gone, 

56
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,150
and some of them

57
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,550
make it look

58
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,750
like her eyes are facing

59
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,030
the entirely wrong direction

60
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,110
she can also make it

61
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,110
look like two faces

62
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,230
somehow glitch together. 

63
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,750
But if you guys

64
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,510
thought this was cool, 

65
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,550
go follow her insta.

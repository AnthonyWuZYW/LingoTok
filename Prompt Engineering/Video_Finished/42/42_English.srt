1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,040
The trauma

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,264
The post traumatic stress of my last performance on the "Jimmy Fallon show"

3
00:00:05,264 --> 00:00:07,360
Last time you were on the show

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,680
This is… This is late night

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,630
We just had met 

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,710
We've never met each other

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,815
And you couldn't be nicer and sweeter 

8
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:14,230
And, gosh,  I'm a fan of yours

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,710
And you…you came out and…and you sat just the way you're sitting

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,270
Very nice and we were talking

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,470
And I just gave you a compliment and then you said:

12
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,870
Before you continue…

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,270
(Before you) even start the interview…

14
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,870
(yeah) I just dove straight in there with…

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,130
I love that Halloween candy thing that you do

16
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,460
And…and I said

17
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,550
And there was just silence

18
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,640
I said the Halloween candy thing. Is that right? 

19
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,040
And you're like, "the candy corn thing?" 

20
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,720
Yeah I thought it…

21
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,320
No

22
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,080
You go, "when you get kids, you trick them."

23
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,100
I go, "That's Jimmy Kimmel. "

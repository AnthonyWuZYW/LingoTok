00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,900
A wolf is a big wild dog roaming around in the landscape

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,490
just trying to feed itself and raise young. 

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,290
A wolf represents or symbolizes the wild to many people. 

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,680
They take on a very romantic, 

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,350
glorified sort of appearance. 

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,150
They're killers. 

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,360
That's what they put on this earth for, was to kill,

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,960
and they're indiscriminate killers. 

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,280
To me, 

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,330
the wolf is a teacher challenging us to think beyond the limitations

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,290
of our current perspectives regarding a lot of things. 

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,490
Makes hair stand up in the back of my neck. 

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,370
When I see one, 

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,950
I'II guess I feel what all these other animals feel their eyes look

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,750
through you. 

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,260
That's very unsettling to people. 

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,220
They're all business, 

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,820
they're afraid of nothing and they're not gonna change. 

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,500
If you want to make them change, 

20
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,660
they say kill me. 

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,680
I ain't gonna change, though.

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,740
That's a wolf.

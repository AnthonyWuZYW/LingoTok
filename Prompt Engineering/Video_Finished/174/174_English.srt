00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,600
I visited Harvard to check out the hardest math class

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,320
in the country, 

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,440
math 55. 

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,040
Apparently, 

5
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,640
this class is so hard that half the students drop out

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,040
after the first semester. 

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,200
And homework assignments can take up to 60 hours a week. 

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,310
As soon as I sat down, 

9
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,190
the professor started throwing up hieroglyphics

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,790
on the board. 

11
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,840
He was really passionate

12
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,190
and I enjoyed listening to him, 

13
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,350
but I wish I knew what he was talking about. 

14
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,750
of course the students around me had no problem. 

15
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,630
These were twenty to thirty of the most brilliant math students

16
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,350
in the country

17
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,030
being science, 

18
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,470
fair winners

19
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,750
and Olympiad medalists. 

20
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,910
They were nailing down every single question

21
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,510
the professor asked and even the ones that I asked.

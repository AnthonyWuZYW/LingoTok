1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,640
If there was a nuclear bomb

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,560
so powerful that itcould completely destroy the moon, 

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,810
the explosion would send moon debris hurtling through space. 

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,490
And if some of this debris was large enough, 

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,610
it could enter a collision course with earth. 

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,470
This collision would release so much energy that it could trigger catastrophic events. 

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,230
And if the conditions were just right, 

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,630
the debris from the moon

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,790
could form a temporary ring around the earth. 

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,070
This would endup blocking the sun, 

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,030
making it dark and significantly cooler.

00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,000
The phone with a unique form factor, 

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,880
rich de Miro takes a look at Samsung latest foldable phone. 

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,670
After Samsung launch event in Paris, 

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,870
I spent the day with their entry level foldable phone, the flip six. 

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:23,240
This year's model has an upgraded look and feel less of a visible screen crease, 

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,600
and the cameras got a big quality boost. 

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,960
The main advantage of a flip style phone is that you can use

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,760
the main cameras for a majority of shots including selfish.

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,400
Samsung calls this flex mode, 

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,960
Samsung flex mode lets you leave the phone half open to give you

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,920
more versatile capture options. 

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,320
A feature called auto frame uses AI to hone in on a subject. 

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,880
It's not always perfect right now we are going for a traditional French lunch. 

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,720
As you can see, the streets here are very crowded.

00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,400
My car is really cool. 

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,240
It has a TV

3
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,160
and enough space for all my friends.

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,440
But i've always wanted it to be sportier, 

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,880
which is why I'm really hoping

6
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,552
that this thing I found on TikTok

7
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:10,320
can help me out. 

8
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,475
This little device supposedly plugs into 

9
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,390
the hidden port that every car has. 

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,710
Let's see if I can find it. 

11
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,830
It's supposed to be down here. 

12
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,350
There it is, right there. 

13
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,040
And then it makes your car sound like a super car

14
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,920
by connecting to your phone and a radio. 

15
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,560
So let's see how it works. 

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,360
if you or your friend has a shitty car, 

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,800
you definitely want this.

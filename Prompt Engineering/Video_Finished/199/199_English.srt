00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,640
All the amazing features

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,520
of iPhone 16

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,800
and iPhone 16 PRO

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,360
wouldn't be

5
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,760
possible without advancements

6
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,920
in chip design.

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,990
A 18

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,150
and a 18 Pro

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,150
are two new custom design chips

10
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,030
that make everything

11
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,470
about your iPhone faster and smoother. 

12
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,990
And that's how a Legend

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,550
does it.

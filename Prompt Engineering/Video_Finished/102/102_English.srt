1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,320
okay I just learned

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,200
the great live hack if you see

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:03,800
something that you

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,720
wanna take a picture of, 

5
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,560
but you left your phone at home, 

6
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,640
don't worry, just do this, 

7
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,000
blindfold yourself for like 30 minutes

8
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,160
and then stare at what you

9
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,360
wanna take a picture of for 

10
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,030
3 minutes. Next, 

11
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,390
pull out one of your eyeballs

12
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,070
and cut it in half top to bottom. 

13
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,150
Throw the back half

14
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,190
into a 14% potassic alum solution. 

15
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,510
Within 24 hours, 

16
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,870
the rhodopsin on your retina

17
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,710
will become fixed

18
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,990
into a permanent image

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,710
of the last thing

20
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,630
you were looking at. 

21
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,210
It's called an optogram

22
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,130
and no one's ever done it. 

23
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,830
At least not to themselves. 

24
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,230
The process was invented

25
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,750
in the late 1800s. 

26
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,230
Here's an optogram from the retina

27
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,950
of a rabbit that

28
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,750
was forced to stare

29
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,470
at a window. 

30
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,510
Now, at the turn of the century, 

31
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,750
this caused a lot of excitement

32
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,870
optograms might help us

33
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,830
solve crimes, right? 

34
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,750
We could look at the eyes

35
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,550
of victims and see

36
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,870
the last thing they saw. 

37
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,670
Unfortunately, optograms are

38
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,830
a very poor quality. 

39
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,870
Here's one from the retina

40
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,630
of a rabbit that looked

41
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,350
at a picture of Salvador Dali. 

42
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,540
Their poor quality

43
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,180
means they have

44
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,140
no forensic value. 

45
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,340
So keep your eyes

46
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,540
in their sockets.

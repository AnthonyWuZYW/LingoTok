1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,540
Hey, Robert,

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,620
can you do this? 

3
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,910
But 1 million times huge. 

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,280
yes We're gonna be able to swim in gummy bears. 

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,150
This is way too slow, 

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,490
Robert, 

7
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,170

8
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,420
mister? 

9
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,210
No, 

10
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,170
why did you break it? 

11
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:14,450
No, 

12
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,320
don't throw it. 

13
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,440
WOW WOW That was just 2,000 times. 

14
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,080
Imagine 1 million gummy bears. 

15
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,680
You better fix this nester. 

16
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,370
What are you doing? 

17
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,810
That's not gonna work. 

18
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,130
Mister. 

19
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,770
Why did you break a lever? 

20
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,040
It's working. 

21
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,900
1 million, 

22
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,440
go back. 

23
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,770
Perfect, 

24
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,370
okay Robert, 

25
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,010

26
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,890
yeah Wait. 

27
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,060
Why? 

28
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,895

29
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:44,775

30
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:45,350

31
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,055
It's loaded. 

32
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:46,750
3 ..

33
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,720

36
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,370
Oh .. Now remember to subscribe, 

37
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,800
so we can read10 million subscribe. 

38
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,280
oh No, 

39
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,340

40
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,500

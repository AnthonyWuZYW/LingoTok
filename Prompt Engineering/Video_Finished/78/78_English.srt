1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,360
Today I'm gonna be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,840
 how to defend yourself if your mom

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,885
ever comes swinging at you 

4
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:04,760
with a sandal. 

5
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,120
That's right. 

6
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,765
Here's my brother 

7
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:06,445
who's gonna be playing 

8
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:07,120
my mom. 

9
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,025
So let's say you did 

10
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:08,400
something wrong, 

11
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,040
right? 

12
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,360
And she swings at you. 

13
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
now you have risk control. 

14
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,845
What you wanna do now 

15
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:14,945
is move the trajectory 

16
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:15,565
of the sandal 

17
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:16,560
away from your face, 

18
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,240
and then pivot inward. 

19
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,250
From here, 

20
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,730
you can either break her arm. 

21
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,915
What I like to do is ...

22
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:23,050
turn it around, 

23
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,560
Now she's discerned, 

24
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,800
and you have full control. 

25
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,680
Hey, 

26
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,550
show me. 

27
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,080
Okay guys, 

28
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,240
this is my actual mom. 

29
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,640
Let's do this one more time. 

30
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's say she swings at you, 

31
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,520
right ...

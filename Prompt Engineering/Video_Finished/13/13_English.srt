00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,620
The baby Winter Games are back. 

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,110
So get ready because we have an epic day of truly shocking moments, 

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,790
heartbreak and triumph. 

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,000
First up curling Sweden versus Canada. 

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,280
Both teams throwing the rock extremely well, 

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,320
but who can handle the pressure, 

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,420
what a shock, even he can't believe it.

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,390
Now, the Canadians,

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,140
no, what just happened.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,450
It looks like an equipment malfunction.

1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,070
When I was a kid, 

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:01,910
I said, 

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,950
if you dug a hole

4
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,070
from the United States

5
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,855
where would you come out 

6
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:05,630
on the other side? 

7
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,350
And all everyone says, 

8
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,070
dig a hole

9
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,470
all the way

10
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,990
to China, 

11
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,350
right?! 

12
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,670
That's always the case. 

13
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,710
However, 

14
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,780
China is not where you

15
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,780
will land. 

16
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,700
If you dig a hole

17
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,300
through the center

18
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,740
of the earth, 

19
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,620
because if you dig

20
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,540
a hole through the center

21
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,060
and you start

22
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,180
in the northern hemisphere, 

23
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:20,920
you have to end

24
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,160
up in the southern hemisphere. 

25
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,680
If you start

26
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,720
in the western hemisphere, 

27
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,465
you gotta end up 

28
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:25,520
in the eastern hemisphere. 

29
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:25,800
That's how

30
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,760
the geometry works. 

31
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,040
Exactly!! Because it's a ball

32
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,680
it's a ball. 

33
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:28,880
Right? 

34
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,320
All right? 

35
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,380
so when I did

36
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,380
the measurements on that, 

37
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,770
if you dug that hole

38
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,010
from the United States

39
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,105
you would end up 

40
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:36,000
in the Indian Ocean

41
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,720
You just fled

42
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,600
the United States

43
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,825
all the water would 

44
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:39,440
come through, 

45
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,600
you pop through, 

46
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,720
and also you like, 

47
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,280
oh lord, 

48
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,400
what have I done?

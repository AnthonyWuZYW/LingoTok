1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,600
One day, 

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,040
Einstein

3
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,480
was sitting

4
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,560
next to an Indian man

5
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,240
on a flight. 

6
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,120
Einstein says ... you know

7
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,280
it's a long flight. 

8
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,840
Why don't we have a competition? 

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,190
I'll ask you a question. 

10
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,590
And if you can't answer it, 

11
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,070
you will give me $5. 

12
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,590
Then you can ask me a question. 

13
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,750
and If I can't answer it, 

14
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,950
i'll pay you $500. 

15
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,110
The Indian man

16
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,750
thought this was

17
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,590
a great deal. 

18
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,430
He told Einstein .... all right 

19
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,440
You go first. 

20
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,240
Einstein asks, how far is

21
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,280
the moon from the earth? 

22
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,480
The Indian man said, 

23
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,200
I don't know the exact answer. 

24
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,510
Here's $5. 

25
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,870
He then looked at Einstein

26
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,870
and asked what

27
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,510
goes up a hill

28
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,270
with three legs

29
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,550
and comes down with four. 

30
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,830
Einstein worked through all

31
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,030
of his knowledge of science, 

32
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,230
but couldn't figure it out. 

33
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,190
so He put his hand

34
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,990
into his pocket

35
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,830
and gave him $500. 

36
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,790
Now, it's Einstein's turn again. 

37
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,990
Einstein said, 

38
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,870
before I ask you my next question, 

39
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,030
what does go up the hill

40
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,190
with three legs and come

41
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,030
down with four? 

42
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,510
The Indian man put his hand

43
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,190
into his pocket

44
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,310
and gave him $5.

1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,120
Ryan wake up, 

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,800
school is not a place to sleep, 

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,640
well then home is not a place to study. 

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,470
Jonathan, 

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,870
stop eating in my class. 

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,510
Dude, didn't you have breakfast this morning?

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:10,950
No, 

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,630
but I didn't have time for my second breakfast, 

9
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,350
Jonathan, 

10
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,015
first eating then talking 

11
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,190
not talking while you're eating. 

12
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,080
Since you've got so much to say, 

13
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,350
name ten elements on the periodic table. 

14
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,860
Second breakfast can I just say that of all the idiots, 

15
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,610
in all the idiot villages, 

16
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,670
in all the idiot worlds, 

17
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,980
you stand alone, my friend, 

18
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,110
fine, I'll come write it on the board 

19
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,220
if you don't believe me. 

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,030
Second breakfast. 

21
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,540
He is officially the smartest kid in the world. 

22
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,220
His mind is greater than all of ours. 

23
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:47,860
Combined. 

24
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,140
His brain power transcends time and space. 

25
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,780
Shall we tell him? 

26
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,820
Absolutely not. 

27
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,320
It's not impossible. 

28
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,310
Sometimes my genius is, 

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,590
it's almost frightening.

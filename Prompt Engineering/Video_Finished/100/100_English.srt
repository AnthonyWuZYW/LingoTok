1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,360
This guy

2
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,840
just threw

3
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,640
a paper airplane

4
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,640
in the football stadium

5
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,120
while a match

6
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,800
was being played, 

7
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,600
and you won't believe

8
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,160
what happened. 

9
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,200
So he gets ready to make

10
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,560
the best paper airplane throw

11
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,160
of his life. 

12
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:08,960
As you can see, 

13
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,320
it kept going straight forward. 

14
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,470
But something amazing

15
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,310
is about to happen. 

16
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,550
You see, the people around him 

17
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,910
started to realize that the plane

18
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,830
wasn't going to stop

19
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,230
and that it

20
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,550
could actually reach the field. 

21
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,750
But that's not the best part. 

22
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,190
Just watch what's about to happen. 

23
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,510
I wonder if any of the players

24
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,310
saw this happening, 

25
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,100
although they were 

26
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,540
probably more focused on the game. 

27
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,980
But as the plane gets closer, 

28
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,660
you can see that it starts turning, 

29
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,100
and the plane is actually going

30
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,090
straight for the goal. 

31
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,360
If you think this guy just made

32
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,800
the best paper airplane throw

33
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,400
of his life, 

34
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,640

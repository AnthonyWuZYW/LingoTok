1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,240
Do you know what happens in just 1 second? 

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,160
In every second on earth,

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,480
24,000 tons of ice melts from our surface. 

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,520
Four people are born and two people pass away. 

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,850
And in the 10 seconds, 

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,010
you've been watching this, 

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:22,170
lightning has struck over 1,000 times producing enough energy to charge your phone for 15,000 years, 

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,600
but it gets crazier

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,510
In this very next second,

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,590
Light just traveled across earth 7 times, 

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,070
and earth itself drifted 18 miles through space. 

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,350
By this point in the video, 

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,080
over 40,000 stars have exploded, 

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,840
and over a million more stars have been born. 

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,840
And Elon Musk, 

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,840
he made nearly the yearly average income in just the duration of this video.

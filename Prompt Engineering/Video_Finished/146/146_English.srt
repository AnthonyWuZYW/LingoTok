1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,320
We should start making

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,880
breakups not relationships, 

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,560
the trend. 

4
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,280
It's clear

5
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,120
how much they

6
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,560
negatively affect

7
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,320
our emotions, 

8
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,160
mental health, 

9
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,520
and even our bodies, 

10
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,720
even people who

11
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,680
aren't religious

12
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,320
are now constantly talking

13
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,240
about the harm. 

14
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,840
These relationships calls

15
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,320
a forbidden relationship

16
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,890
is nothing but regret

17
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,330
our social circles. 

18
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,730
Tv shows and movies

19
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,650
have normalized this

20
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,690
so much that we

21
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,490
can't even see

22
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,810
the damage it's doing

23
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,770
in TV shows

24
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,570
the characters

25
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,930
are with someone new

26
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,670
Every episode

27
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,030
going through all sorts

28
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,110
of experiences, 

29
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,950
and we are seeing

30
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,110
this more and more

31
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,150
in real life, too. 

32
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,055
Please, let's not get caught up 

33
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:38,950
in these normalized ugliness. 

34
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,790
Relationships

35
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,670
shouldn't be taking so lightly. 

36
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,790
They should have

37
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,230
value and meaning. 

38
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,510
You might say we love

39
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,750
each other so much. 

40
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,510
I can't leave, 

41
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,430
but here we

42
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,270
need to weigh

43
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,950
the costs and benefits. 

44
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,200
I'd rather endure

45
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,640
the pain of a breakup

46
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,840
than poison both

47
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,000
of my worldly life

48
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,000
and my afterlife

49
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,880
by engaging

50
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,520
in a forbidden relationship, 

51
00:00:59,530 --> 00:00:59,920
the pain.

25
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,870
Please.

00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,590
Kiki. 

27
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,050
Just ask the nice man, 

28
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,300
if he'd like his omelet made with whole eggs or just egg whites, 

29
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:50,770
you can leave the plate. 

30
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,310
There you go.

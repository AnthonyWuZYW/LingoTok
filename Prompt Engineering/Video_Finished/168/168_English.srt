1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,360
What a brilliant idea. 

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,520
So we can tow it. 

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,160
of course Very sturdy. 

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,960
Let's go. 

5
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,080
hey Stop it, 

6
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,800
hey bro, 

7
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,960
this will damage the car. 

8
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,360
Where's the tow hook? 

9
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,360
I've never bought

10
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,040
a tow hitch. 

11
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,920
All cars have it. 

12
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,310
Come on, let's open the trunk. 

13
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,150
Under this cover. 

14
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,870
There is a set of portable tools. 

15
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,310
look This is the toe hook. 

16
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,615
There is a small cover on 

17
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,430
the front of the car. 

18
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,350
Look, that's it.

19
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,770
We can take it off

20
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,550
by pressing it

21
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,330
with our hands, 

22
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,890
then plug in the toe hook, 

23
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,670
tighten it counterclockwise, 

24
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,200
umfold the toe rope in half and

25
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,280
thread it through the toe hook. 

26
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,680
The long end is the main rope. 

27
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,560
The short end is an auxiliary rope. 

28
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,520
Take the main rope

29
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,400
out of the rope, 

30
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,040
then tighten, 

31
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,280
wrap the auxiliary rope

32
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,240
around the main rope

33
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:39,800
for 1 week, 

34
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,320
hold it in half and thread it

35
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,200
through the loop above, 

36
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,320
then tighten the main row. 

37
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,680
This method is also known

38
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,790
as rage to death cow

39
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,990
because even ten cows

40
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,870
can't break the rope. 

41
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,780
It's also very easy to untie. 

42
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,740
We just need to grab

43
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,780
this auxiliary row, 

44
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,620
then pull it. 

45
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,420
Look, the trailer knot is untied. 

46
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,300
It's really simple, 

47
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,580
right? 

48
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,260
Follow me to make

49
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,500
a friend who knows cars.

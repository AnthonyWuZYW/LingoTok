1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,590
You have a nice heating system and cooling system. 

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,030
You're really something but amazing for you. 

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:06,780
Me, too.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,820
I suggest taking a photo. 

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,690
It's a video, say, hello,

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,550
right there, 

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,750
why don't you introduce yourself to my fans? 

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,960
Yes. 

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,480
And your name is famous. 

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,550
That would be a like a reminder. 

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,730
Yes.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,600
Is there something you want to ask me? 

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,680
No questions asked. 

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,240
I apologize, but I am unable to respond.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,970
It's okay. 

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,250
What's ready for the pulse? 

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,130
Ready or not? 

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,970
Here we come the pulse, right there.

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,690

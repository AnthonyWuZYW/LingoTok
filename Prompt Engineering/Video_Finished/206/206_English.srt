1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,765
Get ready to be 

2
00:00:00,765 --> 00:00:01,520
blown away, 

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,200
because what you're

4
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,040
about to see is

5
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,840
not your average SUV 

6
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,080
it's a game changer. 

7
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,640
Meet the youngwang U8

8
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,040
from BYD

9
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,800
a luxury SUV that

10
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,040
not only dominates

11
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,600
the road, 

12
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,600
but also brace yourself. 

13
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,480
Conquers water. 

14
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,320
This isn't

15
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,360
just a stunt or special effect. 

16
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,840
It's pure engineering

17
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,400
brilliance. 

18
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,480
The U8

19
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,760
can literally submerge

20
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,360
in water and guess what? 

21
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,370
Its engine

22
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,490
and electric motors

23
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,010
keep running

24
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,850
smoothly without a hitch

25
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,970
back on land. 

26
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,145
This SUV shows off yet 

27
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:36,560
another jaw dropping skill, 

28
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,960
the180° slide. 

29
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,750
The U8

30
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,950
gracefully slides

31
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,510
into place

32
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,510
like a seasoned drift champion, 

33
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,070
just when you

34
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,830
think the U8

35
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,190
has shown you everything. 

36
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,560
It pulls off something

37
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,625
that leaves you 

38
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,840
absolutely speechless, 

39
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,920
get this. 

40
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,960
It can do a full

41
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,720
360° turn on the spot. 

42
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,480
That's right. 

43
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,720
You're in a narrow alley

44
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,690
or a tight corner

45
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,330
with no room

46
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,810
to maneuver

47
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,970
no problem for.

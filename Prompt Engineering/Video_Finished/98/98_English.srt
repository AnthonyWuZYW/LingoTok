1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,880
What Einstein said was this. 

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,580
If you don't have anything out in space, 

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,180
that's a flat space. 

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,380
If you were to take

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,340
a planet, a ball, whatever it is, 

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,260
a rocket ship, 

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,780
and roll it, 

8
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,330
it would make a straight line

9
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,480
in that space time. 

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,320
Watch it up on the screen, 

11
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,240
I roll it. 

12
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,760
and It makes a straight line. 

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,230
But according to Einstein, 

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,320
if you go and have a star, 

15
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,000
that star will bend space time

16
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,600
in that extra dimension

17
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,480
that you can't see. 

18
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,040
So you can't see it bend up over there.

19
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,255
But you can see it here 

20
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:41,440
and that bent space time. 

21
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,930
If you roll the ball, ... see, now it looks

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,890
like it's going

23
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,490
around and around that plane.

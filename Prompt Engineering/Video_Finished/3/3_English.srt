Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,560
Today we will make exciting clay model ice creams. 

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,590
First, I will make an ice cream using a blue mold.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,280
I will use the green clay, 

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,880
then i'll fill the mold.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,790
Put sticks in and press it. 

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,270
Yeah. 

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,240
We already have a delicious green ice cream. 

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,090

00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,920
Have you ever wondered

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,480
what the worst year to be alive was? 

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,400
well According to historians, 

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,520
it's the year 536

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,160
during a time called the dark ages. 

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,440
Here's what happened

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,400
and how things just kept getting worse. 

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,800
In 536, 

9
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,680
a massive volcano erupted in Iceland. 

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,680
This resulted in heavy smoke, 

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,840
blocking the sun, 

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,630
creating constant darkness for 18 months. 

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,550
But that's just the start. 

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,390
The darkness LED to global temperatures severely dropping, 

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,030
and because of this crops and irrigation completely fake, 

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,550
leading to mass starvation. 

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,230
But here's the worst part. 

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,750
After a few years of this, 

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,790
the justinian plague hit and spread all across Europe. 

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,070
The plague wipe down up to 50 million people, 

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,830
which at the time was roughly half the world's population, 

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,310
making it the worst year to be alive.

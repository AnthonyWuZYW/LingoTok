1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,385
you know 

2
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:00,805
how you know 

3
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:01,280
When you're driving

4
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:01,800
the wrong cars, 

5
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,360
if I ask you

6
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:02,800
what car you

7
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,240
drive and you

8
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:03,600
tell me

9
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,280
the derivative, 

10
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:04,960
not the brand. 

11
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,400
So if I said, 

12
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:05,960
what do you drive? 

13
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,200
So I drive GT86. 

14
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:07,760
You don't tell me

15
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,080
I drive a Toyota coop, 

16
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,385
ok 

17
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:10,040
right?!!

18
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,600
Because the person

19
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,545
drives an Aston Martin 

20
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,448
doesn't go out drive DV9

21
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:13,110
 yeah

22
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,670
or vanquish. 

23
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:13,950
they asked, 

24
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,430
what do I drive? 

25
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,070
I drive an Aston Martin, 

26
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,750
I drive a Bentley. 

27
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,110
Do you get

28
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,070
enough like a Bentley? 

29
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,950
yeah I don't need to tell

30
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,990
you if it's a Mulsanne

31
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,355
or if it's continental or 

32
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:21,270
it's a Bentley. 

33
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,630
Now, 

34
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,190
the problem

35
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,030
with Toyota was

36
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,510
they were making

37
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,630
their cars in Japan, 

38
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,600
exporting them

39
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,200
to America

40
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,440
for the American person. 

41
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,440
It was still a Toyota, 

42
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,320
it represented

43
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,240
reliability and quality, 

44
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:31,480
but it

45
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,720
didn't quite represent

46
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,360
opulance

47
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,040
and luxury. 

48
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,600
And one day

49
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:34,920
they're having

50
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,400
a conversation

51
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:35,880
about what are we

52
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,160
gonna do

53
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:36,760
with this problem. 

54
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,350
And they thought

55
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,830
the problem

56
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,710
was about pricing

57
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,830
out of nowhere a little voice

58
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,230
from the back

59
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,750
said this is

60
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,670
not a pricing problem. 

61
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,590
It's a brand problem. 

62
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:42,870
So we

63
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,110
should just rather than change

64
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,630
the car, 

65
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,590
just change the logo

66
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:45,990
on the car. 

67
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,150
And then what we call it? 

68
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,110
And the answer was

69
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,470
it's a luxury product. 

70
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,190
What do we do? 

71
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,230
We export it

72
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,310
to the US it's

73
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,555
a luxury export to the US 

74
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,070
Lexus. 

75
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,430
It's a Lexus.

1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,720
This girl is the world's best makeup artists in the world. 

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,880
And you can easily see why every single time she puts on makeup, 

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,840
she creates an absolutely insane illusion. 

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,800
So you can't even tell which part is real or fake

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,470
Like in this one, it looks like she has 2 pairs of eyes. 

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,830
But in the very next one, 

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,510
it looks like her entire face is made out of glass. 

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,270
And although these ones are mind blowing, 

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,550
you won't believe how good number 16 is.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,740
But this one makes it look like her entire face is just one giant mouth, 

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,620
and you can't even tell until she opens her eyes. 

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,540
So that just shows how good her skills really are. 

13
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,150
But the amount of practice she needed to do these must have been a ton

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,910
since only a PRO would be able to do it like she does. 

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,270
But while some of them are like an optical illusion, 

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,630
others are just really good positioning and lighting. 

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,510
But this one makes it look like her face is gone, 

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,008
and some of them make it look like her eyes are facing the entirely wrong direction

19
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,230
while she can also make it looks like two faces somehow bleached together. 

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,550
But if you guys thought this was cool, go follow her insta.

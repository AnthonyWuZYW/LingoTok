00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,200
A new study suggests there may be enough water in the cracks and pores

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,240
of the rock in the middle of the Martian crust to fill the oceans on that planet's surface. 

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,740
The data came from narcissus insight lander. 

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,100
It studied the interior of the red planet from 2018 to 2022, 

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,590
revealing the evidence of this underground reservoir. 

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,430
The study found the ground water would likely cover the entirety of Mars to a depth of 1 Mile. 

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,270
The water is located between 7 and 12 miles beneath the surface if it could ever be accessed, 

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,720
finding suggests that would be a new place to search for life on Mars.

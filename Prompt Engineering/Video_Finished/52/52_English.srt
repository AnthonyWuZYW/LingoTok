1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,440
This is the deepest hole ever made by humans. 

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,896
And in 1970, 

3
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:09,480
the Soviet Union lowered a microphone down the 7-mile tunnel 

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,856
What they heard will scare you. 

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,140
After their 19 years of digging, 

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,024
they reached a depth of 40,000 feet 

7
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:19,860
before the extreme heat melted their equipment. 

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,185
They wanted to see just how deep they could get into the earth 

9
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,750
to retrieve part of its mantle. 

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,704
Since they couldn't dig any further, 

11
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:30,830
they decided to lower a heat-resistant microphone to the bottom of the tunnel, 

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,150
which captured this audio. 

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,640
To this day, people believe that they cracked open the entrance to hell.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,920
Do you think it was real?

1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,265
I'm making some really 

2
00:00:01,265 --> 00:00:01,780
great progress

3
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,825
this week on what is 

4
00:00:02,825 --> 00:00:03,820
one of my biggest

5
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,445
and definitely my most ambitious 

6
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:06,500
mold project to date. 

7
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,860
It's pretty normal mold

8
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,300
at first two parts, 

9
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:09,820
fill it, 

10
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,700
pour it out, 

11
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,020
cut the extra off. 

12
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,440
But then this design

13
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,640
takes a little turn. 

14
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,120
You add

15
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,720
these internal supports

16
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,960
that go under the foot

17
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,080
and hold up the Top. 

18
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,370
Another mold part

19
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,930
is added to the bottom, 

20
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,170
pop it out of the mold. 

21
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,490
And the other new part

22
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,610
is injecting slip

23
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,490
through the Top that cast

24
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,130
the last part

25
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,370
of the bottom seamlessly, 

26
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,135
and we end up 

27
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:33,530
with a fully enclosed form. 

28
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,470
From there, 

29
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,475
i'll add whatever glaze 

30
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:36,790
finishing effects that I

31
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,830
decide I want on it. 

32
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,470
In this case, 

33
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,430
it's dragon's blood. 

34
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,550
So green under glaze biscuit, 

35
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,350
dip it in the grape jelly, 

36
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,990
the other side glaze fire. 

37
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,830
Here we go

38
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,070
the finish piece. 

39
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,760
but Unfortunately, 

40
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,320
it's not quite there yet.

1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,800
Let's find the best study spots. 

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,040
okay I came to a cafe, 

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,520
and this place is a little noisy. 

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,680
Sitting here is just gonna make me wanna buy food

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,480
five out of ten. 

6
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,960
Now I'm outside trying to work. 

7
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,360
And although this is more peaceful, 

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,670
this pollen is gonna make me keep sneezing

9
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,510
four out of ten. 

10
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,590
So now we're at the library

11
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,590
away from the pollen. 

12
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,510
And although this place makes me feel smart, 

13
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,270
these chairs are pretty uncomfortable, 

14
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,030
six out of ten. 

15
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,350
Now I'm back home and I'm working

16
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,060
for my bed. 

17
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,380
I just wanna fall asleep 

18
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,220
two out of ten. 

19
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,300
And now I'm at my desk

20
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,060
with my monitors, 

21
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,440
supplies and everything I need 

22
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,060
ten out of ten.

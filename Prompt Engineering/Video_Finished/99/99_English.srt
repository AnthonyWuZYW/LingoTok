00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,340
In this video, 

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,540
I'm gonna make an obsidian knife

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,140
for my friend, 

4
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,340
because he wants to use it

5
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,380
to fillet a fish. 

6
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,410
This big piece I broke off will be

7
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,610
perfect for our blade. 

8
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,290
To get started on the blade. 

9
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,250
I use a moose antler

10
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,730
to break off big pieces, 

11
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,450
thin it down, and also shape it. 

12
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,640
I make sure to strike

13
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,320
the obsidian in the right areas

14
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,840
with the correct amount of force. 

15
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,560
Otherwise, 

16
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,080
I could risk breaking it in half. 

17
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:25,800
and While I

18
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,880
don't usually wear gloves

19
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,720
in my videos, 

20
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm wearing one in this one

21
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,360
because this stone was so big. 

22
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,090
It's also important that I'm

23
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,010
protecting my leg

24
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,770
with leather pads

25
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,930
during this process. 

26
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,510
We're getting closer

27
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,510
to the finished blade. 

28
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,190
So now I'm using

29
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,950
smaller tools

30
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,990
to sharpen and shape

31
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,910
the blade further. 

32
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,380
To finish the blade, 

33
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,020
I use deer antler to sharpen it, 

34
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,090
as well as create

35
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,250
the tang for it to fit

36
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,930
properly in our antler handle. 

37
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,010
The tang in the blade

38
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,330
also allows me to wrap it

39
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,410
securely to the handle

40
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,290
with deer sinew. 

41
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,000
I made sure to make

42
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,880
this knife thin and really sharp, 

43
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,760
so it'll work well to fillet a fish.

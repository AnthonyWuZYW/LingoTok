1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,485
I made my cat a gym because

2
00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:02,680
he's been putting on a little weight. 

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,945
So I cleared out this room 

4
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:04,880
other than the trampoline, 

5
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,085
because that is going to service 

6
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:07,720
his practice Boxing ring. 

7
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,420
I then moved in his exercise wheel, 

8
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,660
a treadmill, 

9
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,060
a scratching post for working on his climbing, 

10
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,740
a yoga mat for stretching, 

11
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,740
a bench and a dumbbell, 

12
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,500
and then a speed training section. 

13
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,700
It was coming along nicely, 

14
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,025
but the final touch needed 

15
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:22,980
was some mirrors. 

16
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,470
And then after he checked it out for a bit, 

17
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,790
it was time to get a workout in. 

18
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,270
So he started with stretching, 

19
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,350
and he got straight on the exercise wheel. 

20
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,390
He needed a little help, 

21
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,150
but he did great, 

22
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,830
and he was feeling himself afterwards. 

23
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,150
Then he did some grip strength, 

24
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,060
training. 

25
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,620
yes Sir, 

26
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,980
good, 

27
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,000
hold it ... hold it, 

28
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,960
good good oh oh good form. 

29
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,680
He didn't really know how the treadmill worked, 

30
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,680
but that's okay. 

31
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,150
You ready? 

32
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,180
14, not bad.

33
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,930
Great first day, buddy. 

34
00:00:59,680 --> 00:00:59,910
Good

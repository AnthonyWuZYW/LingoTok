1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:03,840
Why are you late? 

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,520
yeah I remember

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,080
when you told me

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,600
yesterday that the bell

5
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,800
does not dismiss you, 

6
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,040
I dismiss you. 

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,800
yeah What about it? 

8
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,440
well If the bell

9
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,440
does not dismiss me, 

10
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,040
it does not tell

11
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:12,600
me when to get

12
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,200
here on time. 

13
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,390
Get out of my class, Ryan. 

14
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,630
Why? 

15
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,190
Because I was 5 minutes late, 

16
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,390
you weren't even in class yesterday. 

17
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,670
I know, but that's not important. 

18
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,870
yeah it is It's way

19
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,590
more important for you

20
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,550
to be here than us. 

21
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,190
The substitute

22
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,470
gave you

23
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,110
homework yesterday, 

24
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,870
put on my desk

25
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,550
on your way out, 

26
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,870
finished it in class yesterday. 

27
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,670
I put it on your desk, 

28
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,030
Ryan. Why are your answers

29
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,910
from question one? 

30
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,990
All the way to question 8

31
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,510
exactly the same as Michael's answers? 

32
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,310
oh I don't know, 

33
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,150
maybe because we

34
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,670
were answering

35
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,950
the same questions. 

36
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,010
Can you believe this? 

37
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,890
oh By the way, 

38
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,450

39
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,250
hey No, talking

40
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,690
to each other

41
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,250
during class. 

42
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,170
Why are you teaching

43
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,250
during my conversation? 

44
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,690
That's it. 

45
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,710
To the principal's office? 

46
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:44,940
Now? 

47
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,860
Fine. Can I go

48
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,550
to the bathroom

49
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,240
on the way? 

50
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,220
What for ...

51
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,890
to open the chamber of secrets?!!!

52
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,970

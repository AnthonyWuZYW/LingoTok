1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,940
Excuse me. 

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,130
yeah 

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,120
How much would you

4
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,880
charge an hour

5
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,520
to let me win

6
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,640
all the arguments? 

7
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,190
uh Like 150? 

8
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,310
All right, get in.

9
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,280
Don't we agree? 

10
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,400
Bowls do not go

11
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,160
on the bottom

12
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,080
of the dishwasher. 

13
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,200
They go on the Top. 

14
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,360
We agree, right?

15
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,650
I right. 

16
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,130
yes You're totally right. 

17
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,820
if you're too cold If the house

18
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,780
is too cold for you, 

19
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,460
you go put on a jacket, 

20
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,940
right? 

21
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,180
Some more layers, 

22
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,900
you don't touch

23
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,900
the thermostat. 

24
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,920
You're so right. 

25
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,320
If I say I don't want to do

26
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,600
the chores now, 

27
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,320
as long as I get

28
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:33,840
them done, 

29
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,480
eventually, that's fine, 

30
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,000
right? 

31
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,600
Yes. That is fine. 

32
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,250

1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,760
It's taken me

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,000
500 years to learn

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,280
these little planting tricks. 

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,560
For corn, 

5
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,800
put it in a container, 

6
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,960
cover with water, 

7
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,760
and wait for it

8
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,640
to sprout, 

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,830
then plant it

10
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,150
in the soil and water it. 

11
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,360
You can now grow

12
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:12,960
your own corn

13
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:13,520
at home

14
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,520
for tomatoes, 

15
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,440
sliced store, 

16
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,040
bought ones

17
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,520
and lay them

18
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,520
flat in nutrient rich soil, 

19
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,420
cover them

20
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,340
with another layer, 

21
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,605
water them regularly 

22
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,540
and wait for them

23
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,260
to sprout. 

24
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,370
This way you

25
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,410
won't have to buy

26
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,370
tomatoes anymore. 

27
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,460
For roses split

28
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,060
a branch

29
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,260
in the middle, insert, 

30
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,760
a piece of chewing gum, 

31
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,260
cut a piece of banana, 

32
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,830
wrap it around the gum, 

33
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,470
secure it with a tie

34
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,110
and cover it

35
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,230
with a plastic cup. 

36
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,800
Add some soil, 

37
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,985
moistened with water 

38
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,200
and roots will form

39
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:41,880
at the wound, 

40
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,010
cut it off, 

41
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,635
transplant it into a pot 

42
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:45,490
and you've got

43
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,570
a new rose bush

44
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,770
for green beans, 

45
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,610
put them in a bottle

46
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,370
with water. 

47
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,520
Shake, well,

48
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,440
punch seven holes

49
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,120
in the cap, 

50
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,160
drain the water

51
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,080
and let it sit

52
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,960
soon, 

53
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,920
the beans will sprout. 

54
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,425
How would you rate them 

55
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,200
out of ten?!!

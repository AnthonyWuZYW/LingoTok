00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,480

9
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,050
A parent probably just grabbed the wrong kid. 

10
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,510

00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,800

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,440
Invest now, buddy

00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,190

25
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,070

26
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,470
sir, 

27
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,630
you're the prime suspect in the kidnapping. 

28
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,110
Did you just take a child from the Midwest police station? 

29
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,560
yeah My son, Alton.

30
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,350
sir, that is not your son. 

31
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,130
Hey, 

32
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,690
could you take off your hood, please? 

33
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,160
Hi. 

34
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,170

35
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,680
I swear, I had no idea.

36
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,930
more candy. 

37
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,310
You can ask your mom. 

38
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,900
Let's go. 

39
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,570
No, 

40
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,050
I want to stay here. 

41
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,810
My mom doesn't let me eat sugar.

1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,560
I want to know

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,320
how you eat

3
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:01,880
a cupcake, 

4
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,560
because I hear you eat

5
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,120
one differently. 

6
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,880
And I want to learn

7
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,440
Obi-Wan. 

8
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,560
ok So I didn't realize

9
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,695
that this was that 

10
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:07,430
unusual Intelligence. 

11
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,110
My friend Steph's, 

12
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,110
40th birthday, 

13
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,430
okay 

14
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,510
and it got Omicron. 

15
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,550
So we couldn't have

16
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,910
a cake. 

17
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,590
So we did a cupcakes. 

18
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,235
I got Omicron 

19
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:14,510
I got Omicron. 

20
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,750
and uh so I took

21
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,470
my cupcake, 

22
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,230
and I was sat there, 

23
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,790
and we were having

24
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,390
a conversation, 

25
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,390
and I did this thing, 

26
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,150
and it stopped the party. 

27
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,150
Now I have stopped

28
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,830
parties before, 

29
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,150
but never for a good reason. 

30
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,070
And this was

31
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,470
a good way

32
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,150
to stop a party. 

33
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,510
So you take the Top. 

34
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,565
oh 

35
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:31,560
and you pull it apart, 

36
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,950
and then you flip it. 

37
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,190
oh 

38
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,795
You like ... 

39
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:34,870
like a whoopie pie, 

40
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,590
almost like you

41
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,195
make it to ..

42
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:36,550
and then you have

43
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,030
a sandwich, 

44
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,990
and you don't get

45
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,420
frosting up your nose. 

46
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,270
um um

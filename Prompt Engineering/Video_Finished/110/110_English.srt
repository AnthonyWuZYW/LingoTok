1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,640
This is how a modern living room should be styled. 

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,760
Normally people buy heavy L shaped sofas

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,040
for a standard living room

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,280
but after a while dust and dirt build up in the hard

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,520
to reach corners underneath

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,280
poor Emily has to bend over every time. 

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,630
She cleans using a big square forklift that barely fits

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,600
plus there's the wall to wall shoe cabinet

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,030
that keeps getting loose turning into a cozy home

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,270
for baby cockroaches

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,870
Emily had enough and decided it was time for a change.

Apple has just announced

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,080
the new iPhone 16, 

3
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,265
and here's what's new 

4
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,025
first colors, along with the usual 

5
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:06,200
white and black leather, teal, 

6
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,040
aquamarine and a pink option, 

7
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,000
adding a pop of color

8
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,680
to the regular iPhone range. 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,350
Also get

10
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,990
a tougher ceramic shield glass

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,790
on the display. 

12
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,750
The display can reach

13
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,790
up to 2,000 nits

14
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,590
in bright daylight

15
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,110
to go as dim as one nit, 

16
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,830
but sadly, 

17
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,990
no 120 hertz. 

18
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,070
Promotion goodness. 

19
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,750
Yet, in this basic model, 

20
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,550
the action button

21
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,150
has been added

22
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,590
from last year's 15 PRO, 

23
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,870
giving you a shortcut key

24
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,635
for different 

25
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:28,470
programmable functions. 

26
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,270
And there's a new button

27
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,750
on the side

28
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,950
called the camera control. 

29
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,380
It's pressure and touch sensitive. 

30
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:32,940
So it can tell

31
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,180
when you're

32
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,660
pressing it

33
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,420
firmly or softly and can be used

34
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,340
to snap photos

35
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,380
or control focus, 

36
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,620
zoom depth of field

37
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,705
or even switch between 

38
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,060
different photographic styles

39
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,550
inside. There's a new a18

40
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,910
processor for really fast, 

41
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,870
powerful performance

42
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,510
and the ability

43
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,590
to run triple a games. 

44
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,830
And apple Intelligence

45
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,295
plus the battery is much 

46
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:50,230
bigger this time, too, 

47
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,030
as for cameras

48
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,670
as a new primary 48 megapixels

49
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,550
so fusion camera

50
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,150
alongside a 12 mega pixel, 

51
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,070
ultra wide camera

52
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,190
with auto focus

53
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,350
for macro ability. 

54
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,190
So what do you think?

1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,400
I'm going

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,280
to a Christian concert

3
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,000
and I don't know

4
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,400
what to wear. 

5
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,680
I'm seeing Forrest Frank and 

6
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,465
Josiah Queen two of my 

7
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:05,360
favorite Christian artists

8
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:05,840
help me choose

9
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,405
an outfit 

10
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:07,665
option One is comfy and cutesy 

11
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:08,520
with the pleaded skirt, 

12
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,385
oversized, chronic 

13
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:10,360
and pastel color palette. 

14
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,160
I absolutely love

15
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,320
the graphics on a sweatshirt. 

16
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,390
Sticking with the pastel theme

17
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,990
for Alpha two, 

18
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,830
the concert is part of

19
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,710
 "the child of god" tour. 

20
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,670
So I thought the overalls were

21
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,590
super fitting, leaning

22
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,470
into my inner kid. 

23
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,150
For option three. 

24
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,470
I'm rocking unit hard robber

25
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,030
with another oversized sweatshirt

26
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,950
for a super chill Look, 

27
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,950
this fit is so comfy, 

28
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,790
perfect for dancing, 

29
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,940
praising all night, long, 

30
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,065
1 .. 2 .. or 3, which one 

31
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:27,700
should I wear tonight?!!

32
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,220
Bye.

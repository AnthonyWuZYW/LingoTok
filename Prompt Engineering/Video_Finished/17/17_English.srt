00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,440
Gentlemen, my latest invention,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,960
the neutron dimensionalizer, 

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,160
I have no idea what that means. 

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,360
Let's see it works. 

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,250
Good!

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,300
 Hi squirrel!  Hi squirrel! 

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,590
Nice one, Jimmy. 

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,990
This dimension is awesome.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,630
Totally awesome. 

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,575
Mp three compatible and a nav system.

11
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,570
Hey guys, 

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,650
I'm swiveling, I'm swiveling. 

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,160
Don't tell my mom.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,440
Do DVDS. 

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,765
Somebody bits me!

16
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:38,520
With over 35 minivans first, 

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,760
including serious backseat TV the Chrysler town and country is

18
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,720
the most innovative family vehicle on the road. 

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,720
Cards are upside down, 

20
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,000
Jimmy, 

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,200
whoa. 

22
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,720
But asking you to mention a thing, 

23
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,460
I'm allowed to change Jimmy.

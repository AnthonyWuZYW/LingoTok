1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,590
Do you know how to spin a ball on your feet? 

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,450
So I can do a lot of things in the basketball. 

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,550
A lot of things which are ain't really my thing. 

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,300
I bet you anything. 

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,080
Drew said, he didn't think you knew how well drew.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,380
You don't be better than that. 

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,470
You think all of your teammates for usab can do it. 

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,600
That is the one thing that I cannot do as a little kid. 

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,800
Don't you just sit here and practice this all day? 

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,520
I can give you like 1/2 a second, 

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,910
maybe1,000 really at the point guard. 

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,150
I don't know how to do Terry's. 

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,220
All right. 

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,680
Jin Zi, I heard you can bounce it off your knee.

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,010
It's about to that's good. 

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,410
Should someone be able to know how to do this if they play basketball? 

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,420
No, you don't have too good.

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,250
Do you know how to spin a ball on your finger? 

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,480
No. 

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,910
I'll be the only guy on the team.

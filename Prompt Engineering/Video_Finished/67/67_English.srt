1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,960
And what's your name? 

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,640
Maggie.

3
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:02,920
I'm sorry. 

4
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,360
Why are you answering for her? 

5
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,800
And he doesn't talk yet

6
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,400
Maggie, we can't take a non-talker. 

7
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,920
Okay What's a good side dish? 

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,810
Rice. 

9
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,370
Why not caviar? 

10
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,880
Oh my god You're not just smart. 

11
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,160
You're brilliant. 

12
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,640
Well look, who's back

13
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,560
Just because Maggie can't talk

14
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,040
Doesn't mean she's dumb. 

15
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,720
Fine. 

16
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,440
I'll give her an IQ test. 

17
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,870
How many eyes do you have? 

18
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,620
Well congratulations. 

19
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,780
You're now as intelligent as a pig. 

20
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,700
Let's see if you can move up to dolphin. 

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,850
How many people in your family? 

22
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,590
oh I got that one, right, too.

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,150
Maggie Simpson, IQ 167. 

24
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,360
My IQ is only 159. 

25
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,680
Maggie is more intelligent than me. 

26
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,280
Our kids keep getting smarter. 

27
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,030
If we have another one. 

28
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,664
It could build a time machine which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids.

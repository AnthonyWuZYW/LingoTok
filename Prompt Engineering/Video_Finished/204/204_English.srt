1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,960
I gave my ants

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,280
a Twinkie and little

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,240
Did I know that this

4
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:03,760
would lead

5
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,560
to a battle

6
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,560
of the species? 

7
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,490
I embedded

8
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,130
the Twinkie

9
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,170
near the ants nest. 

10
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,410
and they swarmed

11
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,280
all over it, 

12
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,860
even toppling

13
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,440
the Twinkie

14
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,310
to the ants. 

15
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,180
The Twinkie was

16
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,760
righteous grub

17
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,490
and they

18
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,610
picked away at it, 

19
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,590
taking it piece

20
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,190
by piece

21
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,350
down to their nest. 

22
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,190
But after a while, 

23
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,870
something unexpected happened, 

24
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,320
they were staying

25
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,640
away from the Twinkies. 

26
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,120
This made no sense

27
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,720
until I took

28
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,680
a closer look. 

29
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,410
I could see

30
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,410
a different species

31
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,650
of small red ants

32
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,210
had taken

33
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,130
over the remnants

34
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,930
of the Twinkies. 

35
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,430
As the big ants

36
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,360
tried to approach

37
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:34,950
the delicacy, 

38
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,060
the short kings

39
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,900
fought them off, 

40
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,660
or should I say

41
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,780
short queens? 

42
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,450
The way

43
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,010
the little ants

44
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,690
do this is they

45
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,290
would latch

46
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,690
onto the antennaes and legs

47
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,570
of the larger ants

48
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,530
scaring them off. 

49
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,850
Later that night, 

50
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,290
something unexpected happened, 

51
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,170
a security camera

52
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,810
caught this have

53
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,850
Alina scarfing

54
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,050
down the Twinkie ants

55
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,730
and all.

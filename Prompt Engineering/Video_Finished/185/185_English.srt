1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,560
The girl gave her boyfriend

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,800
a cute little fox

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,040
as a birthday gift

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,360
little did she know? 

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,000
It would turn

6
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:06,720
out to be one

7
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,000
of the biggest mistakes

8
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,680
of her life, 

9
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,960
the Fox's cuteness

10
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,760
quickly won

11
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,800
the boy's heart. 

12
00:00:11,824 --> 00:00:13,950
bought iyLots of adorable toys

13
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,390
and spent hours playing, 

14
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,510
hide and seek with it. 

15
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,030
The fox, in turn,

16
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,670
loved its owner deeply. 

17
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,630
Every day it

18
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,590
patiently waited

19
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,310
by the window

20
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,990
for him to come

21
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,870
home and then eagerly ran

22
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,590
into his arms for cuddles. 

23
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,310
At night, 

24
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,670
it would excitedly jump

25
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,910
onto the man's bed

26
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,950
wanting to be held

27
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,150
while they slept together. 

28
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,990
However, the girlfriend's arrival

29
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,550
disrupted this harmony, 

30
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,215
the fox became very 

31
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:38,390
anxious and resistant. 

32
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,470
Every morning it

33
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,430
would either hide

34
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,350
under the covers, 

35
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,030
moody or spend the night

36
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,550
howling, non stop. 

37
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,710
Frustrated man had

38
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,390
no choice, 

39
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,990
but to separate

40
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,890
from his girlfriend and sleep

41
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,730
with the fox. 

42
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,290
Instead, 

43
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:50,890
the fox

44
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,770
finally showed

45
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,850
a happy smile

46
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,850
and only then did

47
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,770
the man realize

48
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,930
how much the fox

49
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,450
truly cared for him !!!

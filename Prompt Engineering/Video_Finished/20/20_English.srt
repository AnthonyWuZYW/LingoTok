1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,170
While number ten, 

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,290
Downing Street might see a new prime minister move

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,130
in after the UK elections this week

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,860
There's one resident who isn't going anywhere. 

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:10,980
Larry, 

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,940
the cat known officially as chief mouser to the Cabinet Office has been

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,740
in number ten for more than a decade

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,690
overseeing the departure of four prime ministers. 

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,650
The tabby cat was a rescue adopted by then prime Minister David Cameron

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,576
in 2011 to solve the building's rat crisis.

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,710
His day to day activities at the pm's official residents are:

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,160
according to the government, 

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,310
greeting guests, 

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,750
inspecting security defenses and testing antique furniture for napping quality. 

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,490
While he's seen prime ministers come and go, 

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,600
he's also ignored plenty of famous faces as they visited his abode, 

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,120
including former President Donald Trump, 

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,550
and ahead of a visit by President Joe Biden to Downing Street in 2023. 

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,270
Larry was removed from his favorite spot by a member of the Downing Street team. 

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,990
Larry's resilience and diligence in his role has earned him a place

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,030
in the hearts of the nation as Britain's favorite mog

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,670
and top cat of this most famous street.

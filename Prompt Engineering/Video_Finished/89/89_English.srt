1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,280
does Lucky help you film?!

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,990
No, he doesn't.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,595
I'm very specific with how 

4
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:05,670
I want my angles

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,755
and how I wante to shot 

6
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:07,990
and how I want it to look. 

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,310
So he's offered. 

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,950
I've just politely declined. 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,070
How far in advance

10
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,550
do you plan your TikTok, recipes and videos?!!

11
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,390
that depends on what I'm doing

12
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,310
and what my current situation looks like. 

13
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,270
Sometimes I'm traveling. 

14
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,030
So I preplan some things and I

15
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,430
preshoot some stuff, 

16
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,070
or I just kind of make it up the night

17
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,830
before and I'm like oh

18
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,950
that would be cool tomorrow. 

19
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,390
Or a lot of the times I

20
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,630
film what I would naturally do already, 

21
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,030
like my meal prep videos

22
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,030
I would naturally meal prep. 

23
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,575
And anyway, so I just film that 

24
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,830
or making different dinners

25
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,910
or making my kids things

26
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,950
that they requested, 

27
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,310
because they actually do request

28
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,910
those things. 

29
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,990
so yeah It depends. 

30
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,110
It's a mix of things.

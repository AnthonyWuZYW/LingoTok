1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,185
While fishing a man accidentally ...

2
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:03,285
caught a smiling shark 

3
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:04,600
little did he know

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,400
Years later

5
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,160
they would become good friends. 

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,365
The man released the adorable shark ..

7
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:10,640
back into the ocean. 

8
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,590
6 months later, 

9
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,590
during a dive, 

10
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,870
he unexpectedly encountered it again. 

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,155
The shark happily

12
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,430
swam over and bumped cheeks with the man. 

13
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,070
As if to say, 

14
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,790
hey, 

15
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,430
remember me .. seeing the sharks cute smile. 

16
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,430
The man in instantly realized it was the same shark. 

17
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,190
He had released years ago. 

18
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,995
He was thrilled to see that 

19
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,310
the shark remembered him from then on. 

20
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,110
Whenever he went into the sea, 

21
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,070
the shark would immediately swim. 

22
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,430
Over smiling. 

23
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,070
The man would pet it affectionately and bring, 

24
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,630
treats. 

25
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,470
Before long, 

26
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,230
the shark even brought its wife. 

27
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,615
The man joyfully interacted with them ...

28
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:45,510
and fed them. 

29
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,940
A week later, 

30
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,700
the shark brought its entire family. 

31
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,625
The man found himself surrounded 

32
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,300
by a vast group of sharks, 

33
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,500
a truly awe inspiring sight.

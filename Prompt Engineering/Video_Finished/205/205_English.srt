1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,225
What's really interesting 

2
00:00:01,225 --> 00:00:02,440
with apple devices is

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,920
there's this little ring

4
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,080
around the charging port. 

5
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,960
And if you remove

6
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,480
that ring, 

7
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:06,800
well ....

8
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,760
it actually gives you

9
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,520
the perfect amount

10
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,080
of space

11
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,560
for USB-C port. 

12
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,870
Not sure if that's something apple

13
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,830
did intentionally, 

14
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,470
but Ken

15
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,190
seems to be having

16
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,790
a field day

17
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,470
with the fact

18
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,190
that they did that. 

19
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,670
Now we

20
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,310
have to unscrew

21
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,150
the actual cup, 

22
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,150
and well you think

23
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,390
you just unscrew, 

24
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,110
but no, 

25
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,430
that's not the case. 

26
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,630
So this screw you

27
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,470
unscrew properly. 

28
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,270
Lefty loosy.

29
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,070
Righty Tighty. 

30
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,470
Nice. 

31
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,390
That's all good to go. 

32
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,750
And this screw, 

33
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,390
you actually unscrew

34
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,390
the right way, 

35
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,740
like actually right way, 

36
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,980
clockwise, nice.

37
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,060
And the same goes

38
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,740
for this screw. 

39
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,540
You unscrew it clockwise, 

40
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,700
and then this screw

41
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,860
counterclockwise. 

42
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,580
so The thing

43
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,380
about this mod is

44
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,220
you can't really find

45
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:44,845
these charging port 

46
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,230
replacements online. 

47
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,910
So.. you can actually use

48
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,270
ken's replacement part

49
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,870
as a replacement part. 

50
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,390
And you'll

51
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,350
also get the upgrade

52
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,510
to USB-C which

53
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,430
is pretty awesome. 

54
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,270
We need more people

55
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,350
like Ken in this world.

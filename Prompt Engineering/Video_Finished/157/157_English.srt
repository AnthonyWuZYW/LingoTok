00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,440
Today I'm flying to Iceland

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,400
to find some ice

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,160
because my pet Freddie melted. 

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,240
So I hopped on the plane

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,720
and flew across the globe, 

6
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,960
but I don't see a single cube

7
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,480
of ice here. 

8
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,520
They honestly should have called

9
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,560
this place milk land, 

10
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,360
because all I see

11
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,760
is a bunch

12
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,160
of milk, 

13
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,870
but but I wasn't

14
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,350
ready to give

15
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,510
up. 

16
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,950
I searched

17
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,630
high and found

18
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,390
a secret crater

19
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,230
in the mountains, 

20
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,750
and I searched

21
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,390
low and found

22
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,950
some barrels

23
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,590
in a cave. 

24
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,110
But where are they

25
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,910
hiding the ice? 

26
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,750
I found rocks, 

27
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,830
a couple of waterfalls, 

28
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,150
some funky buildings, 

29
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,870
and even the world's largest flush

30
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,230
button, 

31
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,510
but not a single cube

32
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,750
of ice until I

33
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,150
stumbled

34
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,950
upon this doctor

35
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,550
do finish

36
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,310
looking building

37
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,590
and you

38
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,190
wouldn't believe

39
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,310
it. 

40
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,710
I found

41
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,990
some ice caves inside, 

42
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,430
but where does

43
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,230
this cave go? 

44
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,830
What's at the end

45
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,550
of the tunnel? 

46
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,350
Ice cream?
